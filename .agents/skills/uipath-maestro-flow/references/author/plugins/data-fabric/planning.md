# Data Fabric Entity Nodes — Planning

The Data Fabric entity nodes read and write **records inside a UiPath Data Fabric entity** natively — no Integration Service connection, no HTTP call. They live in the **Data Fabric** section of the add-node panel. Four nodes cover the CRUD surface, and they share one entity picker, one filter grammar, and one `inputs.entityConfig` container.

Use them whenever the flow's own data lives in Data Fabric: a case record, a lookup table, a status the flow advances, an audit row the flow appends.

## Node Types

| Node Type | Canvas label | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core.datafabric.read` | Read entity records | Read one record, or a filtered list of records |
| `core.datafabric.create` | Create entity record | Insert one record and return the stored row |
| `core.datafabric.update` | Update entity record | Patch named columns on one record |
| `core.datafabric.delete` | Delete entity record | Delete one record (no output) |

These are fixed OOTB node types — no registry suffix, no connector key.

Whether your CLI can serve them is a property of the CLI build, not of the tenant, and `registry get <type>` is the only way to find out. Probe it once before planning around a node:

```bash
uip maestro flow registry get core.datafabric.read --output json
```

`Code: NodeGetSuccess` means you can author the node and source its `definitions[]` entry. **"Node not found"** means this CLI does not carry it. Do not ask an administrator to change a tenant setting — no tenant setting governs whether the registry serves this node. Follow [impl.md — Registry validation](impl.md#registry-validation) for the recovery steps and the point at which to give up and use the [connector](../connector/planning.md); it is the single procedure for this error, so do not improvise a different one here.

## Writes require a native entity

Create, Update and Delete work only against **native** Data Fabric entities. A federated entity (one projecting an external system) can be read but never written through these nodes.

Nothing enforces this outside the canvas: the three write panels filter their picker to native entities, but there is **no validation rule**. A hand-authored write against a federated entity passes `flow validate`, serializes, is rejected by Data Fabric, and the rejection is swallowed — a green run that changed nothing. Reads against the same entity keep working, which makes it read like a write bug rather than an entity-class one.

Resolve the class up front with `uip df entities list --native-only --output json` and plan writes only against entities in that list.

## When to Use

Use these nodes when the record lives in **Data Fabric** and the flow itself is the thing reading or writing it.

### Selection Heuristics

| Situation | Use a Data Fabric entity node? |
| --- | --- |
| Look up a record by key to drive a decision or fill a downstream input | Yes — Read, `resultMode: "single"` |
| Fetch a filtered set of rows to iterate over | Yes — Read, `resultMode: "multiple"`, then [Loop](../loop/planning.md) |
| Advance a status, stamp a result, write back an outcome | Yes — Update (native entity) |
| Append a new row (case, audit entry, request) | Yes — Create (native entity) |
| Remove a row the flow has finished with | Yes — Delete (native entity) |
| Write to a federated entity | No — and the connector is not a way round it; writing a federated entity is blocked. Write to the source system instead, via its own connector or [http](../http/planning.md) |
| React to a record being created/updated **elsewhere** | No — that is a trigger; use [connector-trigger](../connector-trigger/planning.md) (`uipath.connector.trigger.uipath-uipath-dataservice.record-created` / `record-updated`) |
| Aggregate, group, or reshape rows already in memory | No — use [Transform](../transform/planning.md) |
| Bulk-load a CSV into an entity | No — that is a data-loading job, not a flow step; use `uip df records import` out of band |
| Read a record from a non-UiPath system | No — use [connector](../connector/planning.md) or [http](../http/planning.md) |

### Native node vs Data Service connector — the operation decides

The `uipath-uipath-dataservice` Integration Service connector also exposes entity operations (`query-entity-records`, `create-entity-record`, `update-entity-record`, `get-entity-record-by-id`, `delete-entity-record`, …), and `registry search` surfaces both families. Route by the operation, in this order:

1. **The user named the connector.** Build the connector activity, provided it exists for that operation. An explicit instruction outranks the default — do not silently substitute the native node.
2. **Record CRUD (read / create / update / delete) → default to the native node.** Confirm it with one `registry get core.datafabric.<op>`; on `NodeGetSuccess` build native. On "Node not found", follow [impl.md — Registry validation](impl.md#registry-validation) and take the connector at the end of it.
3. **Any other entity operation → the connector.** Only those four operations have a native node. Attachments, file-field downloads, entity metadata and bulk operations do not, so the connector is the only path rather than a fallback.

A **federated** entity is not a routing question: writing one is blocked, so the connector is not an alternative path for it. See [Writes require a native entity](#writes-require-a-native-entity).

Where the native node applies and the probe succeeds, it is the better build, because it:

- needs **no Integration Service connection** — nothing to create, bind, or keep healthy, and no `bindings[]` connection row;
- is **user-owned** — author it with `Edit`/`Write` instead of the CLI's `node add` + `node configure` envelope (see [Author capability — Node ownership](../../CAPABILITY.md#node-ownership--who-authors-the-node));
- gives downstream expressions the **record shape** (`$vars.readOrder.output.Status`) with autocomplete, because the picked entity's schema is merged into the node's output definition;
- carries **portable entity bindings**, so a folder-scoped entity survives export to another org.

Whichever way the check sends you, record it in **Open Questions** rather than leaving the reader to guess why the flow took that path.

### Anti-Patterns

- **Do not use Delete to "clear" a field.** Delete removes the whole record. To blank a column, use Update with an empty `value` — but see the nullability caveat in [impl.md — Write bodies](impl.md#write-bodies).
- **Do not chain Read → Update by re-typing the record id.** Use `recordSource: "fromRead"` and point at the Read node; it reuses that node's query, so the two can never drift apart.
- **Do not read a whole entity to find one row.** Push the constraint into `_filters` — a `resultMode: "multiple"` read with no filter returns the first 100 rows in arbitrary order, not "everything".
- **Do not use these nodes inside an API workflow runtime.** All four declare `runtimeConstraints.exclude: ["api-function"]`; the read/write is dispatched by the BPMN engine, which no other runtime implements.
- **Do not feed an Update node's output into a [Loop](../loop/planning.md) collection or a [Transform](../transform/planning.md).** That output is re-read per consumer, and collection consumers are excluded from the rewriting — see [Output Variables](#output-variables).

## Ports

| Node Type | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core.datafabric.read` | `input` | `output` |
| `core.datafabric.create` | `input` | `output` |
| `core.datafabric.update` | `input` | `output` |
| `core.datafabric.delete` | `input` | `output` |

**These four nodes have no `error` port.** Unlike most action nodes, none of them declares `supportsErrorHandling`, so no error handle is ever injected and the properties panel offers no error-handling toggle. Do not set `inputs.errorHandlingEnabled` and do not add an edge with `sourcePort: "error"` — the serializer will still emit a boundary event for it, but with no error mapping, and the canvas shows no handle the author can see or remove. Plan failure handling upstream or downstream instead.

Delete's `output` port exists for **sequencing only** — it carries no data (see below).

## Output Variables

| Node Type | `$vars.{nodeId}.output` |
| --- | --- |
| `core.datafabric.read` (`single`) | The record itself — address columns directly: `$vars.readOrder.output.Status` |
| `core.datafabric.read` (`multiple`) | `{ results: [...] }` — the rows are under `output.results`, never `output` itself |
| `core.datafabric.create` | The **stored** record, including the generated `Id` and server-applied defaults |
| `core.datafabric.update` | The record **after** the write |
| `core.datafabric.delete` | Nothing — the node declares no output definition |

Three consequences worth planning around:

- **A multi-record read is not an array.** `=js:$vars.listOpenOrders.output` is an object; the collection is `=js:$vars.listOpenOrders.output.results`. Wiring the former into a Loop iterates nothing.
- **Update's output is a re-read, not the write's response.** The engine discards the write response; the serializer rewrites each downstream `$vars.<updateId>.output` reference into its own query for the record just written. That is why it cannot be consumed as a Loop or Transform collection — those are excluded from the rewriting and have no snapshot to fall back on.
- **A read that matches nothing does not fault.** Only an *over*-match faults a single-record read. Zero matches completes normally and leaves `$vars.<readId>.output` unresolved, so a downstream Decision silently takes its falsy branch. If "not found" is a real business case, branch on it explicitly.

Delete has no output at all, so plan any post-delete signalling (a count, a status) as a separate [Script](../script/planning.md) or End-node mapping.

## Key Inputs

Every node takes exactly one input object, `inputs.entityConfig`. Its contents differ per node.

### Shared by all four

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `entityName` | Yes | The entity's technical name. Resolve it with `uip df entities list` — never invent it |
| `_folderKey` | Folder-scoped entities only | The entity's `folderId`. Its presence switches the emitted target to the folder-qualified form and makes `bindings[]` entries necessary for portability — see [impl.md — Folder-scoped entities](impl.md#folder-scoped-entities-and-bindings) |
| `_resourceKey` / `_entityKey` | With `_folderKey` | Key the entity's `bindings[]` rows are scoped to |

The canvas also persists schema snapshots (`_entityFields`, `_relatedFields`, `_outputSchema`, `_choiceSets`). They are not decoration — see [impl.md — Schema snapshots](impl.md#schema-snapshots) for when authoring without them silently breaks.

### `core.datafabric.read`

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resultMode` | No | `"single"` (default) or `"multiple"` |
| `_filters` | No | The query. Grouped filter model — see [impl.md — Filters](impl.md#filters) |
| `_selectedFieldNames` | No | Columns to return. Omit for all |
| `_recordLimit` | `multiple` only | Row cap, clamped 1–1000. Omitted resolves to **100** — the emitted query always carries an explicit limit |
| `_skip` | `multiple` only | Rows to pass over first. The only way past the 1000-row ceiling |
| `_sort` | `multiple` only | `{ field, direction: "asc" \| "desc" }`. A limit without an order returns an arbitrary slice |

### `core.datafabric.create`

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fieldValues` | Yes | `[{ field, value }]`. **At least one row must carry a non-blank `value`** — blank values are omitted so the column default applies, so an all-blank config inserts nothing and still runs green |

### `core.datafabric.update`

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recordSource` | Yes (not enforced) | `"byId"` or `"fromRead"`. **The validator does not require it on Update** (unlike Delete) — the serializer infers the mode from whichever selector is populated, so leaving it out is silent |
| `recordId` | `byId` | The record's `Id` — a literal or a `=js:` reference |
| `readEntityNodeId` | `fromRead` | The upstream Read node whose query identifies the record |
| `fieldUpdates` | Yes | `[{ field, value }]`. An **empty `value` writes an explicit null**, which a non-nullable column rejects |

### `core.datafabric.delete`

| Key | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recordSource` | Yes | `"byId"` or `"fromRead"`. The validator requires it — but do not read its absence as "inert" ([impl.md — Record selection](impl.md#record-selection)) |
| `recordId` | `byId` | The record's `Id` |
| `readEntityNodeId` | `fromRead` | The upstream Read node identifying the record |

## Record selection — `byId` vs `fromRead`

Update and Delete both need to name exactly one record, and offer the same two ways:

| Mode | Use when | Cost of getting it wrong |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `byId` | The id is already in hand — a trigger payload, a Create node's `output.Id`, a flow input | A blank or whitespace-only id resolves to nothing; the node runs green having written nothing |
| `fromRead` | An upstream Read already located the record by business key | The write is **skipped silently** if the read matches more than one record, names a node that does not exist, or is itself multi-record |

Prefer `fromRead` when a Read node is already there — it reuses that node's compiled query, so a later change to the filter automatically follows through to the write. But note the asymmetry: on the **read** path an over-match faults the element, while on the **write** path the engine swallows that same over-match and skips the write. A `fromRead` target must therefore be a genuinely single-record read; there is no runtime safety net telling you it was not.

## Common Pattern — read, branch, write back

```text
Trigger -> Read entity records (single, filter by business key)
        -> Decision (on a column)
             -> true:  Update entity record (fromRead) -> End
             -> false: Create entity record            -> End
```

The Decision is doing real work here: a read that matches nothing completes with an unresolved output, so the false branch is also the not-found branch.

## Planning Annotation

In the architectural plan:

- `datafabric: <verb> <EntityName> — <one-line purpose>`, naming the entity and, for a read, whether it is single or multiple.
- Name the **selector** for every Update and Delete (`byId` from `<source>`, or `fromRead` from `<readNodeId>`). An unnamed selector is the single most common way these nodes ship silently doing nothing.
- Record the entity's **class and scope** — native vs federated, tenant vs folder — because writes need native, and a folder-scoped entity needs `_folderKey` plus bindings.
- Put the entity in **Open Questions** when the requirements name a business concept ("the order", "the case") but no entity is confirmed by `uip df entities list`. Do not guess an entity or column name — they are case-sensitive and unmatched names are dropped rather than rejected.
