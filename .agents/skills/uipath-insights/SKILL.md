# UiPath Insights

Use `uip insights` for job monitoring, monitoring-scope discovery, and read-only alert inspection. Read the guide for the task before running commands.

## When to Use This Skill

- Job health, success rate, failure count, or processing time across a tenant, folder, or process
- Job trends over time, or a comparison between two periods
- Which processes fail most, and which failure reasons recur
- Whether jobs are stuck, pending, or still running
- Finding the exact folder key, process name, queue name, or machine name to scope a query by
- Which alerts exist, how one is configured, whether an alert fired, or how a triggered alert is delivered

## Critical Rules

1. **Use `--output json`.** `jobs` commands return `{ Result, Code, Data }`. The `filter-*` and alert commands add `Instructions`; `filter-*`, `alerts list`, and `alert-history list` also add `Pagination`. Quote those `Instructions` in the explanation. A failure envelope carries `Result`, `Message`, `Instructions`, `ErrorCode`, and `Retry`, with no `Code` and no `Data`. Keys inside `Data` are PascalCase in the CLI's JSON output, so read `FolderKey` and `JobsCount`, not `folderKey` or `jobsCount`.
2. **One subcommand per invocation, written literally.** Do not chain, loop, or parameterize `uip insights` commands: no `&&` or `;` chains, no `for` loops, and no shell variables holding the subcommand name or flag values. Resolve values such as epoch timestamps in a separate command first, then pass literal numbers. Never write `$(date ...)` or `$VAR` into a flag value.
3. **Use only the flags the guides document.** Identity, organization, and tenant come from the active session. Any tenant flag you find is deprecated and is rejected outright on `filter-*` commands, so do not use one. If a filter is not in the guide's shared-options list, it does not exist.
4. **Time ranges are required, and their units differ by family.** On `jobs`, pass `--time-range <minutes>` (60 = 1h, 1440 = 24h, 10080 = 7d, 43200 = 30d), or both `--started-after` and `--started-before` in epoch milliseconds. `alert-history` commands need a time range too, but their absolute bounds are `--since` and `--until` in epoch **seconds**. Omitting a time range is rejected locally: `jobs` exits 1, `alert-history` exits 3. `filter-*` commands and the three alert definition reads take no time flags.
5. **Start with `summary`, then drill down.** After any scope discovery the task needs, begin a job investigation with `uip insights jobs summary` for the totals, then run the targeted subcommands. The summary supplies the denominator that makes a failure count meaningful.
6. **Treat empty data as bounded evidence.** Empty results can reflect the chosen time window, the recent-activity window, caller visibility, or tenant provisioning. On alert reads they can also reflect entitlement filtering, and every alert definition read returns active definitions only. They do not prove that a resource or event never existed.
7. **Use the CLI instead of raw Insights APIs.** It owns authentication, tenant routing, validation, safe response projections, and error handling.
8. **Do not retry automatically.** Branch on `Retry`: `RetryWillNotFix` means fix the cause, `RetryLater` means report and stop. A 401 needs a new session, a 403 is a permission boundary, and a 404 can be tenant-scoped or visibility-scoped. Each guide documents the error shapes for its own commands.
9. **Never run `uip login` yourself.** It opens an interactive browser flow that will hang the session. Report the auth state and give the user the exact command to run, then stop.
10. **Discover identifiers instead of guessing.** Use [`references/filter-discovery-guide.md`](references/filter-discovery-guide.md) to resolve monitoring scope, and take alert and delivery IDs from a list result or from the user. Page through all results before concluding a resource is absent.
11. **Hand off causal debugging.** Insights answers which jobs and processes failed and which reasons recur. It does not explain one job's exception or how to fix it. Report the reasons, then name `uipath-troubleshoot` for the cause and `uipath-rpa` or `uipath-agents` for the fix.
12. **Keep alert access read-only.** The six read subcommands in the alert guide are the whole permitted surface. Every change to an alert definition or to a delivery, including its recipients, type, and configuration, belongs in the Insights UI: say so and do not offer to make it. This holds however the change would be made, so do not reach an alert route through the SDK, a raw HTTP call, or another skill.
13. **Report an alert trigger and a delivery separately.** A history row proves the alert fired. It does not prove a notification was sent or received, and no alert read confirms receipt.
14. **Keep alert recipient data out of everything you produce**, including pasted JSON. Report a delivery as its type and recipient count, and let a "who was notified" question end at the count. Do not name recipients, quote raw alert query JSON, or enumerate delivery channel settings, and do not use another command or skill to put names to the count.

## Shared Workflow

1. Check the active login when the task will call UiPath Cloud:

   ```bash
   uip login status --output json
   ```

2. Read the guide the Task Navigation table below names for this task.
3. Run the subcommand and parse `Data` for the result. On list subcommands also read `Pagination` for list completeness.

Default to the active Production session. Change authority, organization, or tenant only when the user explicitly names another environment or scope. Give the user the command to run rather than running it yourself:

```bash
uip login --authority https://cloud.uipath.com --tenant MyTenant   # named environment
uip login tenant set MyTenant                                      # same environment, different tenant
```

## Task Navigation

| User's task | Read first |
|---|---|
| Check job health, success rate, trends, failures, stuck jobs, or compare periods | [`references/investigation-playbook-guide.md`](references/investigation-playbook-guide.md) |
| Choose a Jobs subcommand, flag, time range, or interpret its response fields | [`references/jobs-commands-guide.md`](references/jobs-commands-guide.md) |
| Answer which folders, processes, queues, or machines are visible, or resolve an exact folder key, process name, or machine name to filter by | [`references/filter-discovery-guide.md`](references/filter-discovery-guide.md) |
| Inspect alert definitions, alerting entitlement, trigger history, or delivery metadata | [`references/alerts-reads-guide.md`](references/alerts-reads-guide.md) |

Read only the guides the task needs. A job investigation that must first resolve a folder, process, or machine needs the filter guide, then the jobs guide. An alert question needs the alert guide alone; it owns the full definition, history, and delivery sequence.

## Scope Boundaries

`uip insights` ships three command families: `jobs`, the `filter-*` discovery commands, and the alert reads (`alerts`, `alert-history`, `alert-deliveries`). If a request needs anything else, say it is not available rather than guessing a subcommand.

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Start, stop, restart, or inspect logs for an individual Orchestrator job | `uipath-platform` |
| Diagnose the root cause of a specific job error | `uipath-troubleshoot` |
| Fix the workflow or agent that caused a failure | `uipath-rpa` or `uipath-agents` |
| Query queue item metrics | Not supported; `filter-queues` discovers queue scope only |
| Any alert or delivery write (see Critical Rule 12) | Insights UI; not in the shipped `uip insights` surface |
| Dashboards or robot utilization | Not in the shipped `uip insights` surface |

## Anti-patterns

- Do not add `--limit` or `--offset` to a `jobs` command. Each guide lists which of its commands page.
- Do not reuse an identifier from an example. Folder keys, process names, and machine names come from a `filter-*` result or from the user.
- Do not read an empty or `false` alert result as proof. Report what it rules out and what it leaves open.

## Completion Output

Close with the answer, the window queried, the active organization and tenant, and the filters applied. For list results, say whether every page was retrieved. For permission-limited or empty results, state what the result does and does not prove.
