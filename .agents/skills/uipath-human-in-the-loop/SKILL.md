# UiPath Human-in-the-Loop Assistant

Recognizes when a business process needs a human decision point, designs the task schema through conversation, and wires the HITL node into the automation — Flow, Maestro, Case Management, or Agent.

> **Coded agents:** for wiring HITL inside a coded agent, use the `uipath-agents` skill — see `skills/uipath-agents/references/coded/capabilities/human-in-the-loop.md`.

## When to Use This Skill

- User describes **approval gates** — invoice approval, offer letter review, compliance sign-off, PO authorization
- User describes **exception escalation** — "if confidence is low, escalate to a human", fraud alert review
- User describes **write-back validation** — "human approves before agent writes to ServiceNow / SAP / CRM"
- User describes **data enrichment** — human fills in missing fields the automation cannot resolve
- User describes **agentic output review** — "review AI-generated email/RCA/summary before it goes out"
- User describes **IT change or access approval** — CAB gate, runbook sign-off, access provisioning review
- User describes **HR or contract workflow** — offer letter review, contract approval, termination sign-off
- User describes **financial transaction approval** — payment release, price override, expense over limit
- User describes **customer communication approval** — agent-drafted reply that needs human sign-off before sending
- User explicitly asks to **add a HITL node**, human review step, or Action Center task
- User is building any automation where **a human must act before the process can continue**

**Do not use this skill for:** managing, reassigning, escalating, or monitoring existing Action Center tasks at runtime — use the `uipath-tasks` skill for those operations. When answering a runtime task management question, provide only administration guidance. Do NOT suggest adding a HITL node, flow, or automation as a follow-up tip or recommendation — even if delays or escalations are mentioned.

See [references/hitl-patterns.md](references/hitl-patterns.md) for the full business pattern recognition guide.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never block on schema confirmation.** Design the schema from the prompt and any upstream `.flow`/`caseplan.json` data, write the node, and record the chosen schema prominently in the final report so the user can adjust it afterward. Asking the user is never a precondition for proceeding — if the user is present and offers input, use it, but do not wait for it. Only stop and report the open decision when the request is genuinely too ambiguous to make any reasonable inference. (A prompt that already specifies the fields, outcomes, and output shape is never too ambiguous.)
2. **Always wire the `completed` handle.** A HITL node with no outgoing edge on `completed` blocks the flow forever. Only `completed` is available as an output handle — **not** `output`, `success`, or any other name. This is true even when inserting into an existing flow whose other nodes use `"sourcePort": "output"`.
3. **Always add the definition entry when inserting into an existing flow.** Before writing the node, check `workflow.definitions[]` for the correct `nodeType` for the selected path (`"uipath.human-in-the-loop.quick-form"` for QuickForm, `"uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app"` for app-based). If absent, append the full definition entry (with `handleConfiguration` including the `completed` handle). Skipping the definition means the `completed` handle is invisible to the runtime and the wiring check fails.
4. **Regenerate `variables.nodes` after adding the node.** Replace the entire `workflow.variables.nodes` array — do not append. See the reference docs for the algorithm.
5. **Validate after every change.** Run `uip maestro flow validate <file> --output json` after writing the node and edges. The `uip` CLI does not accept `--format`; using it produces `error: unknown option '--format'` and exit code 3.
6. **Read the existing `.flow` file before adding.** Understand which nodes already exist and where the HITL checkpoint belongs in the flow.
7. **The definition entry is added once per node type.** Check `workflow.definitions` — if an entry with the matching `nodeType` is already there, do not add it again.
8. **Check existing node IDs before generating a new one.** Read `workflow.nodes[*].id` from the `.flow` file and pick the next available suffix (e.g. `invoiceReview1`, then `invoiceReview2`).
9. **Never report a failed validation as done.** If `uip maestro flow validate` returns errors, diagnose from the JSON output and fix before reporting to the user.
10. **Output fields are accessed by `field.id`, not `field.variable`.** The runtime result object uses field IDs as keys — `$vars.<nodeId>.output.<fieldId>`. The `variable` property only creates a workflow-global alias; it does NOT change the key used in the node output object, and it is NOT how downstream scripts read the value.
    - WRONG: `$vars.legalApproval` — this is the global alias path, not the script access path
    - WRONG: `$vars.<nodeId>.output.legalApproval` — this uses the variable name as the key
    - RIGHT: `$vars.<nodeId>.output.approved` — uses `field.id` ("approved") as the key
    In every downstream script, use `$vars.<nodeId>.output.<fieldId>` where `<fieldId>` is the `id` you gave the field in the schema — never the `variable` name.
11. **Input field binding paths use the upstream output key, not the HITL field's own `id`.** These are two different things: the HITL field `id` identifies the form field (always lowercase); the binding path key is the name used in the upstream script's `return` statement (preserves camelCase). If a script returns `{ supplierName: "Acme" }`, the correct binding is `vars.fetchSupplier.output.supplierName` — writing `suppliername` (the field `id`) produces a path that does not exist at runtime. The form field will be blank; `flow validate` will not catch it. Always derive the binding key from the upstream script source, not from the HITL schema you are designing.
12. **Downstream scripts must access `$vars.<nodeId>.output`.** Any script node that runs after the HITL node must read `$vars.<nodeId>.output` (the result object) — do not rely solely on `$vars.<nodeId>.status`. Concrete example: `const output = $vars.reviewNode1.output; const reason = output.reason;`. This is required even when the primary routing uses `status`.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve the `uip` binary

```bash
UIP=$(command -v uip 2>/dev/null || npm root -g 2>/dev/null | sed 's|/node_modules$||')/bin/uip
$UIP --version
```

Use `$UIP` in place of `uip` for all subsequent commands if the plain `uip` command isn't found.

> **Local dev note:** If working inside the uipcli repo, replace `uip` with `bun run start`.

---

## Step 1 — Detect the Surface and Find the Flow File

Run these checks in order:

```bash
# Check for a .flow file (Flow project)
find . -name "*.flow" -maxdepth 4 | head -5

# Check for a Case Management project. The on-disk filename varies
# (caseplan.json, or content/<name>.json.bpmn under a `uip maestro case init`
# project) — detect by content marker, not by filename.
find . -maxdepth 4 -iname "*.json*" -print0 2>/dev/null | xargs -0 grep -l '"case-management:root"' 2>/dev/null | head -3

# Check for agent.json (Low-Code Agent project)
find . -name "agent.json" -maxdepth 4 | head -3

# Check for Maestro .bpmn (Maestro process)
find . -name "*.bpmn" -maxdepth 4 | head -3
```

| Found | Surface | How HITL is added |
|---|---|---|
| `.flow` file | **Flow** | Write node JSON directly — see reference docs |
| `caseplan.json` (any `*.json` with `root.type: "case-management:root"`) | **Case** | Write `action` task into stage — see [hitl-casetask-action.md](references/hitl-casetask-action.md) |
| `agent.json` | **Low Code Agent** | Escalation CLI in-flight — guide manually for now |
| `.bpmn` (Maestro) | **Maestro** | Write the `UserTask` XML directly — see Step 5 Surface: Maestro |

**If the user mentioned a specific file path**, use that directly.

**If no `.flow` file exists and surface is Flow**, scaffold solution-first — Flow projects MUST live inside a solution:

```bash
# Probe the solution verb once per session before scaffolding:
#   uip solution init --help --output json
# Success → use `solution init` (post-rename, default).
# `unknown command` → CLI predates the rename; substitute `uip solution new <SolutionName>` below.

uip solution init <SolutionName> --output json
cd <SolutionName> && uip maestro flow init <ProjectName>
# Creates: <SolutionName>/<ProjectName>/<ProjectName>.flow
```

The flow file path is `<SolutionName>/<ProjectName>/<ProjectName>.flow` (double-nested). `<SolutionName>/` is the solution directory (contains the `.uipx` file); `<ProjectName>/` inside it is the flow project. By convention `<SolutionName>` and `<ProjectName>` are often the same string, but they are two distinct scaffolding arguments. Run `uip maestro flow init` outside a solution and it auto-scaffolds `<ProjectName>Solution/<ProjectName>/` for you; running `uip solution init` first lets you control the solution name (otherwise it defaults to `<ProjectName>Solution`). Passing `--skip-solution-registration` leaves a bare single-nested `<ProjectName>/<ProjectName>.flow` layout that fails Studio Web upload, packaging, and downstream tooling.

---

## Step 2 — Read the Business Context

Read the existing `.flow` file to understand current nodes and edges. Use the Read tool on the `.flow` file path, then identify:
1. **Where** the human decision point belongs (after which existing node)
2. **What the human needs to see** — data produced by upstream nodes
3. **What the human must provide back** — data needed by downstream nodes
4. **What actions they can take** — the named outcome buttons
5. **Form type**: QuickForm (inline schema, node type `uipath.human-in-the-loop.quick-form`) or AppTask (deployed coded app, node type `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app`)?

---

## Step 2b — Proactive HITL Recommendation

**If the user did NOT explicitly mention HITL**, scan the business description for these signals before proceeding:

| Signal | Pattern | Why a human checkpoint matters |
|---|---|---|
| "agent writes to", "updates", "posts to" an external system | Write-back validation | Prevents incorrect writes to production systems |
| "if confidence is low", "when uncertain", "edge case" | Exception escalation | Agent cannot resolve autonomously |
| "approves", "reviews", "signs off", "four-eyes" | Approval gate | Business or compliance requirement |
| "fills in missing", "validates extraction", "corrects" | Data enrichment | Automation produced incomplete data |
| "compliance", "regulatory", "audit trail" | Compliance checkpoint | Mandated human sign-off |

**Never block on this.** When a signal is clear-cut (an explicit approval / review / sign-off requirement), add the HITL step and state that you did so, in this form:

> "I noticed that [quote the specific part of their description]. This is a [pattern name] — a point where [brief consequence if no human reviews]. I'm inserting a Human-in-the-Loop step here so that [human role] can [action] before the automation [continues/writes/sends]."

Proceed straight to schema design after saying this — do not wait for a reply. Record the decision prominently in the final report so the user can remove the step if they disagree. Only skip adding it and report the open decision when the signal is genuinely ambiguous (not just "no explicit HITL mention" — the signals table above is itself the ambiguity test).

**Example:**
> User: "Build an automation that reads support tickets, uses AI to generate an RCA, and updates the ticket in ServiceNow."
>
> Agent: "I noticed that the automation writes AI-generated content directly back to ServiceNow. This is a write-back validation pattern — if the RCA is incorrect and nobody reviews it, wrong data goes into production tickets. I'm inserting a Human-in-the-Loop step so that a support lead can review and optionally edit the RCA before the update is applied."

---

## Step 3 — Choose Task Type

**The options differ by surface.** Never block here — pick the option that best fits the surface and the business description, state the choice, and proceed. Only ask when the user is actually present and available; in a non-interactive run, infer and move on.

### Surface: Flow

Infer the right option from the signals below and state your choice — do not perform a registry search first, and do not wait for the user to pick before proceeding.

| # | Option | Node type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **QuickForm** | `uipath.human-in-the-loop.quick-form` | Inline typed form — fields rendered by Action Center from the schema you design here |
| 2 | **New Coded Action App** | `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app` | Scaffold a new React + TypeScript app inside the solution — full UI control |
| 3 | **Existing Deployed App** | `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app` | Reference an app already deployed to Orchestrator |

> **Default: QuickForm.** Pick QuickForm unless the request explicitly names a deployed app, a coded action app, or a custom UI requirement — those are the only signals that point at options 2 or 3. State the choice, do not ask: "I'll use QuickForm — it's inline, no deployment step needed, and works for most approval and review tasks. You can swap in a Coded Action App or an existing deployed app later if you need one."

| Option chosen | Next step |
|---|---|
| QuickForm | Read [How to write a QuickForm HITL node](references/hitl-node-quickform.md) for Steps 1–2, then continue with Step 4 |
| New Coded Action App | Read [How to scaffold a new Coded Action App](references/hitl-node-coded-action-app.md) for Step 4c details, then continue with Step 4 |
| Existing Deployed App — the request must already name the app | Read [How to wire an existing deployed Action App](references/hitl-node-apptask.md) for Step 4b details, then continue with Step 4 |

**Fallback rules — never block on these, fall back and state what you did:**

| Path | Blocker | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Existing Deployed App | App not found in Orchestrator, or no app name was given | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "I couldn't find (or wasn't given) a deployed app name, so I used QuickForm instead. Point me at a real app name and I'll swap it in." |
| New Coded Action App | No `dist/` build present in the source path | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "The source folder doesn't have a `dist/` build yet, so I wired a QuickForm for now — run your build and ask me to swap in the Coded Action App once it's ready." |
| New Coded Action App | No source path given | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "No app source path was given, so I used QuickForm to wire the checkpoint now. Point me at the app code and I'll replace it with a Coded Action App." |
| Any custom app | Auth expired (401 on API call) | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "The session looked expired, so I used QuickForm rather than stall on re-authenticating. Run `uip login` and ask me to swap in the app when you're ready." |

---

### Surface: Case

Infer the right option from the description below — do not pull the registry first, and do not wait for the user to pick before proceeding.

| # | Option | Fingerprint | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **QuickForm (file-based schema)** | separate `<TaskLabel>.hitl.json` file + `hitlType: "quick"` context entry in the action task | Structured form fields in a `.hitl.json` file alongside `caseplan.json`. Action Center renders fields at runtime. No deployed app needed. |
| 2 | **App-based action task** | `data.name` and `data.folderPath` as `=bindings.<id>` references + `data.actionCatalogName` | Uses a deployed Action Center app with custom input/output fields. Requires the app to exist in Orchestrator. |

> **Default: QuickForm.** Pick QuickForm unless the request explicitly names a deployed Action Center app. State the choice, do not ask: "I'll use QuickForm — it's the quickest to set up, supports structured form fields, and doesn't need a deployed app. You can upgrade to an app-based task later if you need a custom UI layout."

> **Build vs design time.** QuickForm in case management must round-trip both ways: the JSON written here is what Studio Web's case designer reads (design time), and what `uip maestro case validate` + Action Center render at runtime (build time). Always validate after writing.

| Option chosen | Next step |
|---|---|
| QuickForm (file-based schema) | Read [references/hitl-casetask-action.md — Path 1](references/hitl-casetask-action.md#path-1--quickform-file-based-schema-no-deployed-app), then continue with Step 4 |
| App-based action task — the request must already name the app | Read [references/hitl-casetask-action.md — Path 2](references/hitl-casetask-action.md#path-2--app-based-action-task-deployed-action-center-app), then continue with Step 4 |

**Fallback rules — never block on these, fall back and state what you did:**

| Path | Blocker | Response |
|---|---|---|
| App-based | App not found in registry or `action-apps-index.json`, or no app name was given | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "I couldn't find (or wasn't given) that app, so I used QuickForm instead. Point me at a real app name and I'll swap it in." |
| QuickForm | Schema design rejected on validate (e.g. duplicate field IDs, missing primary outcome) | Fix the schema yourself from the validator's error and re-validate. Apply Step 4b checks. Note the fix in the final report — do not pause to re-show the schema first. |
| Any | Auth expired (401 on API call) | Fall back to QuickForm and proceed. State: "The session looked expired, so I used QuickForm rather than stall on re-authenticating. Run `uip login` and ask me to swap in the app when you're ready." |

---

## Step 4 — Common configuration

Never block on these — use the stated default when no answer is available, write it into the node, and note the default in the final report so the user can change it.

| Timeout | Default: 24 hours. If the description states or implies a different duration, use that instead. |
| Priority | Default: Low. If the description states or implies urgency (e.g. "high priority", "urgent", "time-sensitive"), use High or Medium accordingly. Write the chosen value into the node's `priority` field — asking the question is not enough; the value must land in the node. |

---

## Step 4b — Schema Design Resilience (QuickForm — Flow and Case)

Apply these checks while designing the schema, before writing it — per Critical Rule 1, do not wait on the user to confirm. Applies equally to Flow QuickForm nodes and Case QuickForm action tasks — same `fields[]` + `outcomes[]` shape, same `direction` semantics.

### Field direction

Pick direction based on what the human does with the field:

| Signal | Direction |
|---|---|
| "can see", "shown to", "read-only", "displays", "context for reviewer" | `input` |
| "fills in", "enters", "types", "selects", "required decision", "approves" | `output` |
| "can edit", "can correct", "pre-filled but editable", "suggested value the reviewer can adjust" | `inOut` |

`inOut` means the field is pre-populated from an upstream node AND the human can modify it before submitting. The runtime exposes it under `$vars.<nodeId>.output.<fieldId>` the same as an output field.

### Field types

Use the JS/JSON type that fits the field: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`, or `file`. These are the only valid values — do not use `text`. Case also supports `datetime` (distinct from `date`, for full date+time values) — see [hitl-casetask-action.md](references/hitl-casetask-action.md) for the Case-specific type table.

### Vague or incomplete schema descriptions

If the user says something like "just add some fields" or "use whatever makes sense":

1. Infer sensible defaults from the upstream data and downstream needs visible in the `.flow` file (Flow) or in `caseplan.json` upstream task `outputs[]` and `root.data.uipath.variables` (Case).
2. Show the proposed schema explicitly before writing: "Here's what I'm proposing — let me know if you want to change anything."
3. If there is nothing upstream to bind to (Flow with only a trigger; Case with this as the first task), use output-direction fields only and note: "There are no upstream values to pull data from, so the reviewer will fill in all fields from scratch."

### Empty field labels block validation

Every field in `inputs.schema.fields` must have a non-empty `label`. `flow validate` emits `HITL_QUICK_FORM_FIELD_LABEL_REQUIRED` (error severity) for each field with an empty or whitespace-only `label` — Debug and Publish are blocked until all labels are filled in. Never generate a field with `"label": ""` or omit the `label` key.

---

## Step 5 — Write the Node Directly

### Surface: Flow — QuickForm (inline schema only)

Write the node JSON directly into `workflow.nodes`, add the definition to `workflow.definitions` (once), wire edges into `workflow.edges`, and regenerate `workflow.variables.nodes`. **Direct JSON is the default.**

Node JSON, definition entry, edge format, `variables.nodes` algorithm, and four worked examples: **[How to write a QuickForm HITL node](references/hitl-node-quickform.md)**

**CLI (opt-in):** When the user explicitly requests a CLI command:

```bash
uip maestro flow hitl add <path/to/file.flow> \
  --label "<TaskLabel>" \
  --priority <Low|Medium|High> \
  --assignee <email-or-group> \
  --schema '<json>' \
  --output json
```

The CLI writes the node, adds the definition entry, and updates `variables.nodes` automatically. Wire the `completed` port after it returns.

After writing, validate:

```bash
uip maestro flow validate <file> --output json
```

### Surface: Flow — Coded Action App (new inline)

Step 4c must be completed first — app name confirmed, solution directory located, SDK tarball identified, schema designed and confirmed.

Scaffold the project directory and all source files, add the project to the solution, write the solution resource files, then write the HITL node (type `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app`) with `inputs.app` referencing the new app (`appSystemName: null` since the app has not been deployed yet).

Full project template, UUID generation, solution CLI commands, resource file templates, node JSON, and post-creation build steps: **[How to scaffold a new Coded Action App](references/hitl-node-coded-action-app.md)**

After writing, validate:

```bash
uip maestro flow validate <file> --output json
```

### Surface: Flow — AppTask (deployed action app only)

Step 4b must be completed first — app resolved, configuration retrieved. Then:

Resolve the solution context (`.uipx` file), write solution resource files, register the app reference, merge `debug_overwrites.json`, then write the node JSON (type `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app`) with `inputs.app` populated from the Step 3b configuration.

App search/selection, retrieve-configuration, resource file writing, complete node JSON with `appInputBindings`: **[How to wire an existing deployed Action App](references/hitl-node-apptask.md)**

After writing, validate:

```bash
uip maestro flow validate <file> --output json
```

### Surface: Case

Read the `caseplan.json` to identify the target stage. Write an `action` task directly into `stage.data.tasks[lane][]`. **Direct JSON write is the only supported method** — the `uipath-maestro-case` skill ships no `hitl` CLI subcommand (unlike Flow's `uip maestro flow hitl add`).

Full reference: **[references/hitl-casetask-action.md](references/hitl-casetask-action.md)** — three task JSON shapes (QuickForm, generic, app-based), field reference, assignee handling, post-write verification, and downstream output access.

| Path chosen in Step 3 | What gets written |
|---|---|
| QuickForm | A `<TaskLabel>.hitl.json` schema file (unified `fields[]` with `direction`, `outcomes[]`) + action task in `caseplan.json` with `data.context[hitlType].value: "quick"`, `_schemaFileId` (placeholder UUID), and `hitlSchemaId` (matches `schemaId` in `.hitl.json`). `data.inputs[]` and `data.outputs[]` are empty arrays. No `root.data.uipath.bindings[]` entries. Apply Step 4b schema-design checks before writing. |
| App-based | Action task with `data.actionCatalogName`, `data.name` and `data.folderPath` as `=bindings.<id>` references. Add 2 root-level bindings. |

After writing, validate (build-time check — must pass before reporting success):

```bash
uip maestro case validate <caseplan.json> --output json
```

> `uip maestro case validate` is the only `uip maestro case` CLI used by this skill on the Case surface. All authoring is direct JSON.

---

### Surface: Low-Code Agent

The Low-Code Agent escalation CLI (`uip agent escalation add`) is currently in-flight. Until it ships, configure manually:

**`agent.json` escalation entry:**
```json
{
  "escalations": [
    {
      "name": "<escalation-name>",
      "inputSchema":  { "inputs": [...], "inOuts": [...] },
      "outputSchema": { "outputs": [...], "outcomes": [...] }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Agent source (Python):**
```python
from uipath.sdk import interrupt, CreateTask

response = interrupt(CreateTask(
    escalation_name="<escalation-name>",
    data={ "fieldName": value }
))
# response contains the human's outputs and chosen outcome
```

### Surface: Maestro

QuickForm and coded-action-app HITL nodes are both supported on Maestro BPMN processes. `uipath.human-in-the-loop.quick-form` and `uipath.human-in-the-loop.coded-action-app` are registered as **registry shortcut names** in the BPMN validator ([bpmn-spec.json](../uipath-maestro-bpmn/validator/bpmn-spec.json)) — these are palette/discovery identifiers, not literal XML to write. There is no dedicated CLI subcommand for Maestro (unlike Flow's `uip maestro flow hitl add`) — write the node directly into the `.bpmn` XML.

**Confirmed node shape (verified by direct reproduction against a real Studio Web BPMN process with a working, editable QuickForm task):**

```xml
<bpmn:task id="Activity_InvoiceApproval" name="Invoice Approval">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <uipath:activity version="v1">
      <uipath:type value="Actions.HITL" version="v2" />
      <uipath:context>
        <uipath:input name="hitlType" type="string" value="quick" />
        <uipath:input name="taskTitle" type="string" value="Please review this invoice and approve or reject" />
        <uipath:input name="labels" type="string" />
        <uipath:input name="priority" type="string" value="Medium" />
        <uipath:input name="actionCatalogName" type="string" />
        <uipath:input name="enableActionableNotifications" type="boolean" value="false" />
        <uipath:input name="assignmentCriteria" type="string" />
        <uipath:input name="recipient" type="json" />
        <uipath:input name="_schemaFileId" type="string" value="<see file-id callout below>" />
        <uipath:input name="hitlSchemaId" type="string" value="<matches schemaId in the .hitl.json sidecar>" />
        <uipath:inputSchema type="jsonSchema"><![CDATA[{"$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#","type":"object","properties":{"invoiceid":{"type":"string","title":"Invoice ID"},"amount":{"type":"number","title":"Amount"}},"required":[]}]]></uipath:inputSchema>
      </uipath:context>
      <uipath:input name="HitlTaskArguments" type="json" target="bodyField"><![CDATA[{"invoiceid":"INV-1001","amount":500}]]></uipath:input>
      <uipath:output name="Action" type="string" source="=Action" var="invoiceDecision" options="[{&#34;value&#34;:&#34;Approve&#34;,&#34;label&#34;:&#34;Approve&#34;},{&#34;value&#34;:&#34;Reject&#34;,&#34;label&#34;:&#34;Reject&#34;}]" />
    </uipath:activity>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
  <bpmn:incoming>edge_into_task</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>edge_out_of_task</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:task>
```

Notes on what's easy to get wrong:
- **Element is `bpmn:task`, not `bpmn:UserTask`.** `bpmn-spec.json`'s generic `Actions.HITL` XML template uses `bpmn:UserTask` and `version="v1"` — that template is for the app-based/coded-action-app path (its `context` fields are `appId`, `appVersion`, `actions`, `key`, `taskTitle`). A real QuickForm task exported from Studio Web is a plain `bpmn:task` with `uipath:type value="Actions.HITL" version="v2"`. Use the shape above for QuickForm; the spec's template for app-based.
- **`<uipath:inputSchema>` (last child of `<uipath:context>`) and `<uipath:input name="HitlTaskArguments">` (sibling of `<uipath:context>`, not inside it) are both required.** Without them the "Edit Schema" canvas in Studio Web doesn't open at all — confirmed by direct reproduction. This mirrors the Case surface's `data.inputSchema`/`data.inputs[]` requirement — see [hitl-casetask-action.md § Step 3](references/hitl-casetask-action.md) for the parallel Case shape and full field-by-field rationale.
- **The `Action` output requires a matching process-level variable declaration** — add `<uipath:inputOutput id="<varId>" name="Action" type="string" elementId="<taskId>" />` inside the process's top-level `<uipath:variables version="v1">` block.
- **A separate `<TaskLabel>.hitl.json` sidecar file is required**, same shape as the Case surface's (`title`, `fields[]` with `direction`/optional `colSpan`/`binding` or `variable`, `outcomes[]` with **no** `action` key, `schemaId`) — see [hitl-casetask-action.md § Step 2](references/hitl-casetask-action.md) for the exact shape; it's identical across both surfaces.
- **`_schemaFileId` cannot be authored blind — it is a server-assigned foreign key, not a UUID you invent.** A placeholder value makes "Edit Schema" fail silently (a `404` on Studio Web's internal `FileOperations/File/Rename` call, confirmed by direct reproduction). There is no `uip` CLI command that resolves this today. **Never block on this.** Write a fresh placeholder UUID v4, finish the rest of the node, validate, and move on — do not attempt the live reconciliation yourself and do not stop to ask about it. State plainly in the final report: "This task's schema was written with a placeholder `_schemaFileId`, so Studio Web's 'Edit Schema' canvas won't open for it yet. Making it editable requires resolving the real file ID Studio Web assigns to the `.hitl.json` after upload (`GET /api/Project/{projectId}/FileOperations/Structure`) and pushing it back with a targeted single-file update (`PUT /api/Project/{projectId}/FileOperations/File/{fileId}`) — not another whole-project `uip solution upload`, which re-pushes every file and mints a fresh random file ID for each one, undoing the fix. Ask me to do this reconciliation if you want the schema editable in Studio Web." This is a real product/tooling gap the user can act on later, not something to resolve mid-task.
- **Diagram-interchange edges are required for the connector lines to render, even though the logical `bpmn:sequenceFlow`s already exist.** Every `bpmn:sequenceFlow` needs a matching `bpmndi:BPMNEdge` (with two `di:waypoint` points, aligned to the source/target shapes' connecting edges) in the `bpmndi:BPMNPlane` — omitting it leaves the nodes logically connected but visually disconnected in the canvas. Confirmed by direct reproduction.

Design the schema per Step 4b — never block waiting on the user, per Critical Rule 1 — then validate frequently (`uip maestro bpmn validate <file>.bpmn --output json`) while wiring the node so any shape mistakes surface immediately rather than at deploy time. In Maestro, field names in `outputs`/`inOuts` must exactly match declared process variable names and types.

## Step 6 — Report to the User

After completing the wiring:

1. **What was inserted** — node ID, label, insertion point
2. **Schema summary** — what the human will see (input-direction fields), fill in (output/inOut-direction fields), and click (outcomes). For deployed action app show the actionSchema from the retrieve-configuration api response here.
3. **Edges wired** — which handles were connected and to which nodes; any handles left unwired
4. **Runtime variables** — `$vars.<nodeId>.output` (object) and `$vars.<nodeId>.status` (string) and how to reference them downstream
5. **Validation result** — pass or errors to fix
6. **Production readiness note:**
   - **QuickForm**: ready to deploy once the solution is packaged. No additional build steps.
   - **New Coded Action App**: the app must be built (`npm run build` inside the app source) and the solution packaged before the HITL task can be used in production. The app will appear with `appSystemName: null` until first deployment assigns it a system name.
   - **Existing Deployed App**: ready to deploy immediately — the app is already live.
7. **Next step** — pack and publish when ready via `uipath-development` skill
