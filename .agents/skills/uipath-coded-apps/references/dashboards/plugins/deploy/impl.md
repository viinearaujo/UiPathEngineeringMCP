# Dashboard Deploy Plugin

Publishes a built dashboard to Automation Cloud as a Coded Web App.

**Pipeline order:** Production build → Pack → Publish → Deploy.

> **What the user should see:** The deploy plan (Step 4), progress ticks, and the final URL. All other steps are silent — run commands, read outputs in context, never echo raw JSON or bash output to the user.

---

## Pre-flight

Verify login and read state.json:

```bash
uip login status --output json
```

Check `Data.Status === "Logged in"`. If not, stop and ask the user to run `uip login`.

Read current deployment state from `.dashboard/state.json` — extract `app.name`, `app.routingName`, `app.semver`, `deployment.systemName`, `deployment.folderKey`, `deployment.folderName`.

If `routingName` is empty: tell the user to run the build first.

---

## Step 0 — Determine the deployment target (governance vs standard)

A dashboard deploys one of two ways — pick before anything else:

| Target | Where it goes | Tags | Elevated perms? |
|--------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| **Governance / admin dashboard** | the `AdminDashboards` folder, pinnable to the Governance section *(pinning is an Agentic Governance **preview** feature — see Step 4)* | `governance` (+ `dashboard` if pinned) | yes — Administrators get Folder Administrator on AdminDashboards |
| **Standard dashboard app** | a regular Orchestrator folder the user chooses | `dashboard` | no |

**Infer the target from `.dashboard/state.json`, then let the user correct it in the plan (Step 4):**
- **Governance** when any widget's metric is a governance / runtime-compliance metric — its name starts with or equals `violations-`, `agents-by-violations`, `agent-governance-violations`, `recent-violations`, `rule-evaluations-`, `rule-compliance`, `agent-compliance-report`, `policy-denials`, `governance-verdicts`.
- **Standard** otherwise — a dashboard that happens to show agent health / jobs / KPIs is a normal app, not a governance dashboard.

If `deployment.folderKey` is already set in state.json (a prior deploy), keep that target — don't re-ask.

When genuinely ambiguous (or the user's wording conflicts with the inference), ask ONE structured-choice question (SKILL.md Rule 18): *"Deploy as a governance/admin dashboard (Admin portal, elevated) or a standard dashboard app (a folder you pick)?"* A free-text reply takes precedence.

Everything below marked **(governance only)** runs solely for the governance target; the **(standard only)** notes give the regular-app path.

---

## Step 1 — Provision AdminDashboards folder *(governance only; skip if folderKey already set)*

**Standard target:** skip this step. Resolve the user's chosen deploy folder to a key instead — ask which folder (or use one they named), then `uip or folders list --output json` and match on `Name` (per SKILL.md Rule 11). Persist it as `deployment.folderKey`/`folderName` in state.json. No folder is created and no roles are assigned.

If `deployment.folderKey` is already in state.json, skip this entire step.

Run the provisioning script (silent — no output to user until "AdminDashboards folder is ready"):

```bash
node "<SKILL_BASE_DIR>/assets/scripts/dashboards/setup-admin-folder.mjs" "AdminDashboards" "<PROJECT_DIR>"
```

`<PROJECT_DIR>` is the dashboard project directory (e.g. `<cwd>/agent-health-x7k2`). The script reads `.dashboard/state.json` to check if already provisioned and exits immediately if so.

The script:
1. Looks up the Folder Administrator role key, the Administrators group key, and the AdminDashboards folder in parallel.
2. Creates the folder if it does not exist.
3. Reads existing role assignments before assigning — `roles assign` replaces all roles, so the script builds the full union to avoid removing existing access.
4. Persists `folderKey` and `folderName` into `.dashboard/state.json`.

> ⚠️ The script's role assignment step grants elevated folder permissions. The coding agent will ask for explicit approval — this is expected.

If the script fails with "Administrators group not found": run `uip or users list --username "Administrators" --output json` and show the user the available groups.

Tell the user: "AdminDashboards folder is ready."

---

## Step 2 — Classify deploy type

- `deployment.systemName` is empty → **Fresh deploy**
- `deployment.systemName` is set → **Upgrade**

---

## Step 3 — Set the publish version

The version used for pack + publish (Steps 6–7) is `NEXT_SEMVER`, derived by deploy type:

- **Fresh deploy** (`deployment.systemName` empty): first publish — use `app.semver` as-is. `NEXT_SEMVER = <CURRENT_SEMVER>` (no bump; the version doesn't exist yet).
- **Upgrade** (`deployment.systemName` set): the current version is **already published**, so you **MUST** bump before pack/publish — re-publishing the same version fails with "version already exists". This bump is mandatory, not optional; never pack/publish an upgrade at `<CURRENT_SEMVER>`. Compute the next patch:

  ```bash
  node -e "
  const [a,b,c] = process.argv[1].split('.').map(Number)
  process.stdout.write([a, b, c + 1].join('.'))
  " <CURRENT_SEMVER>
  ```

  This gives `NEXT_SEMVER`. Pack (Step 6) and Publish (Step 7) MUST pass `--version "<NEXT_SEMVER>"`.

Step 7 (Publish) still auto-bumps and retries on a 409 / "already exists" as a backstop — but on an Upgrade you bump here first; do not skip the bump and rely on the retry alone.

---

## Step 4 — Show deploy plan (and, governance only, ask about pinning)

`<FOLDER_NAME>` is `AdminDashboards` for the governance target, or the user's chosen folder (state.json `deployment.folderName`) for the standard target.

```
Your **<APP_NAME>** is ready to be deployed.

📦  Version:    <SEMVER> → <NEXT_SEMVER>
🔗  URL path:   <ROUTING_NAME>
📁  Folder:     <FOLDER_NAME>
🔄  Type:       Fresh deploy  OR  Updating existing deployment
```

**(governance only)** If this is a fresh deploy, also show:
```
⚠️  I'll create the AdminDashboards folder and assign Administrators as Folder Administrators.
    This requires elevated permissions — the coding agent will ask for your approval once.
```
**(standard only)** Show no elevated-permissions warning — deploying to a regular folder assigns no roles.

End the deploy plan with: `Confirm to deploy, or tell me what to change.` — **pure text, no tool calls in this response. HALT.**

**On the user's reply:**
- Change request / cancel → handle it; re-present if changed
- **(standard target)** Any confirmation → proceed with `--tags "dashboard"`, ask nothing. There is no Governance pinning for a standard dashboard.
- **(governance target)** Confirmation that already settles pinning (e.g. "deploy and pin" / "deploy without pinning") → proceed with the matching tags, ask nothing
- **(governance target)** Bare confirmation → ask ONE short structured-choice question (SKILL.md Rule 18): *"Pin this dashboard to the Governance UI?"*

  | Option | Meaning |
  |--------|---------|
  | **Deploy and pin** | Visible in the Governance section (`--tags "governance,dashboard"`) |
  | **Deploy without pinning** | Deploy only (`--tags "governance"`) |

  Free-text replies remain valid and take precedence.

  > ⚠️ **Pinning is a preview feature.** Surfacing a dashboard in the Governance section depends on **Agentic Governance**, which is currently limited to organizations enrolled in the preview program. State this when offering the pin option: *"Pinning surfaces the dashboard in the Governance section — that's an Agentic Governance preview feature, so it only takes effect if your org is enrolled in the preview. Either way the dashboard deploys and is reachable at its URL."* If the org isn't enrolled, the deploy still succeeds and the app is fully usable via its URL — only the Governance-UI pin has no visible effect until preview access is granted (contact your UiPath representative).

---

## Step 5 — Production build

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && npm run build
```

If build fails: show the error.

No `.env` dance — the SDK config lives in `uipath.json`. The `uipathCodedApps()` Vite plugin reads it and injects `<meta name="uipath:*">` tags into `dist/index.html` at build time; the SDK (`new UiPath()`) reads its config from those tags at runtime. No tokens are baked into the bundle.

**Verify the SDK config is injected into the built `index.html`** — turns the silent "UiPath SDK configuration not found" runtime crash into a build-time stop. The org-name meta tag must appear:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && node -e "
const fs=require('fs')
const html = fs.existsSync('dist/index.html') ? fs.readFileSync('dist/index.html','utf8') : ''
process.stdout.write(html.includes('uipath:org-name') ? 'CONFIG_OK' : 'CONFIG_MISSING')
"
```

If it prints `CONFIG_MISSING`, `uipath.json` lacked `orgName` at build time — re-run the build (the build script writes `uipath.json`) and re-check. **Never deploy a `CONFIG_MISSING` bundle** — it loads blank in the browser. **Skip this check for template builds** (Step 6b) — a tenant-neutral template intentionally omits the org name.

---

## Step 6 — Pack (silent)

`-n` is the **friendly Title Case display name** (state.json `app.name`, e.g. `"Jobs Health Dashboard"`) — **never the routing slug.** The CLI sanitizes it to a slug (`jobshealthdashboard`) internally for package matching, but uses the friendly name as the display name in the catalog and Governance UI. Passing the slug makes the dashboard show up as `jobshealthdashboard`; the friendly name reads "Jobs Health Dashboard". Use the **same** `-n` for pack, publish, and deploy.

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && uip codedapp pack dist -n "<APP_NAME>" --version "<NEXT_SEMVER>" --output json
```

---

### Step 6b — Template packaging (only when shipping a reusable template)

A **template** is a dashboard distributed in the ejected regime: one artifact carrying both the deploy face (`dist/`) and the agent-modifiable source. Before `pack`, stage the source + manifest into `dist/_source/`:

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && node "${SKILL_BASE_DIR}/assets/scripts/dashboards/build-dashboard.mjs" --pack-template <PROJECT_DIR>
```

This stages a **tenant-neutral** modify-face (`intent.json`, `src/`, config files, `uipath.json` with tenant identity blanked — only `scope` retained) plus `template.json` (scaffoldVersion, sdkFloor, requiredScopes, routingName, `ejected: true`) into `dist/_source/`, then emits `TEMPLATE_PACKED` with the `pack` command. It never stages `.dashboard/`, `node_modules`, or `dist`. Run the normal `pack` (above) afterward.

> **Caveat — `dist/_source/*` is web-served.** The platform serves `dist`, so embedded source is publicly fetchable at the app URL. Ship it ONLY for shareable, tenant-neutral templates — never a customer's private dashboard.

**Tenant-neutral runtime config.** A template build (`intent.template: true`) writes a scope-only `uipath.json` (no org/tenant/base-url/client-id), so the plugin injects only the `uipath:scope` meta tag — **no** tenant identity is baked into the bundle. At runtime the UiPath Apps host injects the remaining `<meta name="uipath:*">` config tags (org/tenant/base-url/client-id) and loads the app with `?host=embed`; the scaffold's `useAuth` calls `new UiPath()`, which reads that config and delegates the token to the host. So the same bundle is portable across tenants.

> **Skip the CONFIG_OK check (Step 5) for template builds.** That check greps `dist/index.html` for the org-name meta tag, which a tenant-neutral template intentionally omits — it would false-fail. Config arrives from host-injected meta tags at runtime instead.

---

## Step 7 — Publish (silent)

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && uip codedapp publish -n "<APP_NAME>" --version "<NEXT_SEMVER>" --output json
```

Read the JSON output (silent — no output shown until success or error):
- **Success** (`Result === "Success"`)→ extract `DeploymentVersion`, continue
- **Contains "409" or "already exists"** → bump version once more, re-pack, retry publish (up to 4 attempts total)
- **Contains "5xx" or HTML** → this is a transient gateway error; wait 10 seconds and retry (up to 4 attempts)
- **Other error** → surface it to the user, stop

---

## Step 8 — Deploy

Set tags based on the deployment target (and, for governance, the user's pinning choice):
- **Standard target** → tags = `"dashboard"`
- **Governance target**, "deploy and pin" → tags = `"governance,dashboard"`
- **Governance target**, "deploy" (no pin) → tags = `"governance"`

Two flags differ from pack/publish — getting these wrong is the most common deploy failure:

- **No `--version` on deploy.** The CLI resolves the latest published version itself. Passing `--version` triggers a false `"...has not been published yet"` error.
- **`--path-name` only on a FRESH deploy.** It sets the URL slug the first time. On an **upgrade** the routing name already exists — re-passing `--path-name` errors with `"routing name must be unique"`.

**Fresh deploy** (`deployment.systemName` was empty):

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && uip codedapp deploy \
  -n "<APP_NAME>" \
  --path-name "<ROUTING_NAME>" \
  --folder-key "<FOLDER_KEY>" \
  --tags "<TAGS>" \
  --output json
```

**Upgrade** (`deployment.systemName` is set — omit `--path-name`):

```bash
cd <PROJECT_DIR> && uip codedapp deploy \
  -n "<APP_NAME>" \
  --folder-key "<FOLDER_KEY>" \
  --tags "<TAGS>" \
  --output json
```

Read the JSON output:
- **Success** → extract `SystemName` and `AppUrl`, continue
- **Contains "indexing" or "not been published"** → platform propagation delay after publish. Show `↻ App is indexing — retrying in 10 seconds (attempt N/3)…`. Wait 10 seconds and retry (up to 3 times). If all 3 fail, surface the error and stop.
- **(Fresh deploy only) Contains "conflict", "already exist", or "name must be unique"** → the routing slug is taken; generate a new suffix and retry the fresh deploy (keep `--path-name`):

```bash
node -e "
const base   = process.argv[1].replace(/-[a-z0-9]{4}$/, '')
const suffix = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2, 6)
process.stdout.write(base + '-' + suffix)
" <ROUTING_NAME>
```

Use the new routing name in a fresh deploy call. Retry up to 3 times.

- **Other error** → surface it to the user, stop

---

## Step 9 — Update state.json

```bash
node -e "
const fs = require('fs')
const fp = '.dashboard/state.json'
const s  = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(fp, 'utf8'))
s.app.semver                    = process.argv[1]
s.app.routingName               = process.argv[2]
s.deployment.systemName         = process.argv[3] || s.deployment.systemName
s.deployment.deployVersion      = process.argv[4] || s.deployment.deployVersion
s.deployment.appUrl             = process.argv[5] || s.deployment.appUrl
s.deployment.pinnedToGovernance = process.argv[6] === 'true'
s.deployment.lastDeployedAt     = new Date().toISOString()
fs.writeFileSync(fp + '.tmp', JSON.stringify(s, null, 2))
fs.renameSync(fp + '.tmp', fp)
" <NEXT_SEMVER> <ROUTING_NAME> <SYSTEM_NAME> <DEPLOY_VERSION> <APP_URL> <PIN_TO_GOVERNANCE>
```

---

## Step 10 — Report

```
🎉 **<APP_NAME>** is live.

<APP_URL>

Version <NEXT_SEMVER> · <FOLDER_NAME>
```

**(governance only)**
- If pinned: "Your dashboard is pinned to the Governance section. Note: the Governance section is an **Agentic Governance preview** feature — if your org isn't enrolled in the preview, the pin won't appear there yet (contact your UiPath representative for access). The dashboard is live and fully usable at the URL above regardless."
- If not: "To pin it later, say 'redeploy and pin to governance'."

Always: "To update after making changes, say 'deploy this dashboard' again."

## Error reference

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Folder Administrator" role not found | Run `uip or roles list --output json` and show the user the available roles |
| Administrators group not found | List groups from the response, ask user which to use |
| Build fails | Show the error — dev credentials are always restored |
| Publish 409 | Auto-bump version and retry (up to 4 times) |
| Publish 5xx / HTML | Wait 10s and retry (up to 4 times) |
| Deploy "indexing" / "not been published" (with NO `--version` passed) | Propagation delay — show retry ticker, wait 10s, retry up to 3 times |
| Deploy "not been published" but you passed `--version` | Remove `--version` from the deploy call — deploy resolves the latest version itself |
| Deploy "routing name must be unique" on an upgrade | You passed `--path-name` on an upgrade — omit it; routing already exists |
| Deploy path-name conflict (fresh deploy) | Generate new suffix, retry deploy only (pack/publish already done) |
| "Agentic Governance is a preview feature and is not enabled for your organization" (on a pinned/governance deploy) | Not a deploy failure — the app IS deployed and reachable at its URL. Governance pinning is preview-gated: the pin just won't surface in the Governance section until the org is enrolled. Report success with the URL, add the preview note (Step 10), and tell the user to contact their UiPath representative for preview access. Do NOT retry or bump the version. |
| state.json missing | Tell user to run the build first |

## Rules

- `-n` is the **friendly Title Case display name** (state.json `app.name`, e.g. "Jobs Health Dashboard") — same across pack, publish, deploy. Never the routing slug: the CLI slugifies it for package matching but shows the friendly name in the catalog/Governance UI.
- `--version` goes on **pack and publish only — NOT deploy.** Deploy resolves the latest published version; passing `--version` causes a false "has not been published yet" error.
- `--path-name` goes on **fresh deploy only** — it sets the URL slug. On an upgrade the routing already exists; re-passing it errors "routing name must be unique."
- Routing name is permanent after the first successful deploy.
- Always include `--tags`. Standard target → `dashboard`. Governance target → minimum `governance`, add `dashboard` if the user opted to pin.
- Determine governance vs standard target first (Step 0). Only the governance target provisions `AdminDashboards`, assigns elevated roles, and offers Governance pinning; the standard target deploys to a user-chosen folder with no role assignment and no pin prompt.
