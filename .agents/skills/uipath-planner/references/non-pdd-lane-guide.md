# Non-PDD Lane Guide

When the planner is invoked without an SDD (the entry guard found no `## Planner Handoff` marker, or the user picked "Other context" at the entry guard prompt), it runs Lane B — elicit preferences, detect project type, write a plan, hand off to specialists. This guide covers Lane B end-to-end.

> Lane B is appropriate for non-trivial UiPath requests without a PDD: ambiguous tasks, multi-skill orchestration, project-type detection from the filesystem. For trivial single-skill tasks, the main agent should load the specialist directly without the planner.

## Step 1 — Upfront elicitation (batched)

Bundle every unresolved question from the table below into **one** `AskUserQuestion` call. Do not ask one at a time; do not split across turns. If a question is already resolved from the user's request, omit it from the batch. If **all** are resolved, do not call `AskUserQuestion` at all and record the inferred values in the plan header with a one-line note in Decisions & Trade-offs.

Question phrasing follows the rules in [pdd-driven-lane-guide.md → Step 5](pdd-driven-lane-guide.md#step-5--ui-element-targeting-only-when-9-contains-ui-applications): no internal jargon, no domain or app names in question text.

If the entry guard classified a provided document as "Other context", read it before building the batch — any question its content answers counts as resolved, and the content feeds the plan.

### Skip-rules table (apply before building the batch)

| Question | Skip when | Default if skipped |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 Generation approach | Request is simple and well-defined; the user is modifying an existing automation; or the task is single-skill single-step. | `simultaneous` |
| Q2 Execution autonomy | Explore-first mode (the approval gate at plan time already scopes autonomy). | `autonomous` |
| Q3 Project type fallback | Project type resolves via explicit naming, keyword signals, or filesystem (Step 3) — see "Project type" below. | `RPA workflow (XAML)` |
| Q4 Solution scope (Flow only) | Plan does not load `uipath-maestro-flow`; OR the user already stated intent (e.g., "upload to Studio Web", "keep it local", "just build it"); OR the plan contains no generation skill. | Omit `Solution scope` field from the plan header entirely. |

The batch contains only the questions that survive the skip rules. Build the `AskUserQuestion` call as one tool invocation with one `questions` array entry per surviving item.

**Delivery-model constraint (no standing question).** When the request carries self-hosted signals ("Automation Suite", "on-prem", "self-hosted", "air-gapped"), apply the [Constraint Gate](product-selection-guide.md#constraint-gate) against [platform-availability-guide.md](platform-availability-guide.md) before recommending any product, and record `Delivery model: <value>` in the plan header. If the signals are present but ambiguous (can't tell Suite from standalone), add the delivery-model question from [sdd-generation-guide.md → Step 0](sdd-generation-guide.md#step-0-determine-execution-mode--delivery-model) to the Step 1 batch. No signals → omit the field; do not ask.

### Question 1 — Generation approach

> How would you like me to work?
>
> 1. **Explore first, then plan** — analyze the project and requirements, run non-mutating discovery, then present a plan for approval before any project changes *(recommended for non-trivial requests)*
> 2. **Explore, plan, and execute simultaneously** — emit the plan as text and the main agent starts executing right away

**If "explore first, then plan":**
- You may run non-mutating discovery: `uip rpa analyze`, `uip rpa get-errors`, reading `project.json`.
- Do NOT run commands that mutate the project (create files, register targets, install packages) — those belong to execution.
- After Steps 2–4, call `EnterPlanMode` with the plan. User approves → `ExitPlanMode`.

**If "explore, plan, and execute simultaneously":**
- Emit the plan as text in Step 5. The main agent loads the first specialist skill immediately and follows that skill's own workflow.
- Do NOT call `EnterPlanMode`.

### Question 2 — Execution autonomy

> Once execution starts, how should I handle ambiguity or scope concerns?
>
> 1. **Autonomous to completion** *(recommended)* — follow the plan end-to-end without stopping for confirmation. Specialist skills handle their own pause points (auth failure, UI capture limits, etc.).
> 2. **Interactive** — pause and confirm on structural decisions, scope concerns, or side-effect actions during execution.

Record the answer in the plan header as `Execution autonomy: autonomous | interactive`. Specialist skills read this field at runtime — in autonomous mode they do NOT re-ask decisions the plan already makes.

### Project type — infer first, ask only if vague

Resolve project type without asking when possible. Stop at the first match:

1. **User explicitly named a mode** ("xaml workflow", "coded workflow", "C# workflow", ".cs file", "low-code") → honor it. Record `Project type: XAML` or `Project type: C# coded` in the plan header.
2. **Keyword signals** (look for these in the user's request, but do not echo them as labels) →
   - "agent", "AI agent", "agentic", "LLM", "LangGraph", "LlamaIndex", "OpenAI Agents" → **AI Agent**
   - "flow", "orchestrate multiple automations", `.flow` → **Flow**
   - "web app", "app", "React", "Angular", "Vue", `.uipath/` → **Application**
3. **Filesystem signals** (Step 3) → route per the Step 3 table.
4. **Default** → **RPA workflow (XAML)**. Covers ~95% of UiPath work — UI automation, form-fill, Excel / email / file ops.

If the request is genuinely vague ("I want to build something with UiPath") AND no keyword or filesystem signals apply, **add Q3 to the Step 1 batch** — do not fire it as a separate `AskUserQuestion` call:

> Q3 — What kind of project should I scaffold?
>
> 1. **RPA workflow** — UI automation, Excel / email / file work *(recommended — covers ~95% of UiPath work)*
> 2. **AI Agent** — autonomous agent that reasons with an LLM and calls tools
> 3. **Flow** — visual node-based orchestration connecting multiple automations
> 4. **Application** — custom UI deployed as a UiPath App

If the user picks **RPA workflow**, record `Project type: XAML` and move on. **Never follow up with "XAML or C#?"** — that authoring-mode decision belongs to `uipath-rpa`, not the planner. Coded mode is set only when the user independently says "coded workflow" or ".cs file" (which rule 1 above already honors); never as a follow-up. **Never surface C# coded as a top-level recommendation for routine UI automation** — the coded fallback is an internal `uipath-rpa` decision.

### Question 4 — Solution scope (Flow projects only)

**Include this question in the Step 1 batch only when the plan loads `uipath-maestro-flow`.** For RPA / AI Agent / Application plans, omit the question entirely **and omit the `Solution scope` field from the plan header** — no other specialist reads it.

> Where should this Flow solution live?
>
> 1. **SW solution** — build and iterate in Studio Web.
> 2. **Local solution** — build and iterate locally in VSCode.

Record the answer in the plan header as `Solution scope: SW | local`. `uipath-maestro-flow` reads this field at runtime to decide whether to publish at the end.

**Skip Q4** (and omit the field from the header) when:

- The plan does not load `uipath-maestro-flow`.
- The user's request already states the intent (e.g., "upload to Studio Web", "keep it local", "just build it") — record directly.
- The plan contains no generation skill (pure diagnostics, pure `uipath-platform` ops, pure read-only work).

### Default — Expression language

Always use **VB.NET** for XAML workflows. Note this in the plan. Do not ask.

## Step 2 — Detect multi-skill requests

Before filesystem detection (Step 3), check whether the request matches a multi-skill pattern. Multi-skill requests usually combine "build" + "deploy", "build" + "verify", or one product depending on another.

See [multi-skill-patterns-guide.md](multi-skill-patterns-guide.md) for the 6 named patterns. If the request matches one, emit a multi-skill plan in that pattern's order. Otherwise, treat it as single-skill and proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3 — Filesystem detection (single-skill requests)

> **Check first:** if the request mentions deploy / publish / Orchestrator alongside a clear domain, it likely needs a multi-skill plan from Step 2.

Probe the project context:

```bash
echo "=== CWD ===" && ls -1 project.json *.cs *.xaml *.py pyproject.toml flow_files/*.flow .uipath/ app.config.json .venv/ 2>/dev/null; \
echo "=== PARENT ===" && ls -1 ../project.json ../*.cs ../*.xaml ../pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null; \
echo "=== FRAMEWORK ===" && cat project.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"targetFramework"[^,}]*' || echo "targetFramework: not found"; \
echo "=== DONE ==="
```

| Filesystem signal | Plan skill |
|---|---|
| `.xaml` AND/OR `.cs` files + `project.json` | `uipath-rpa` |
| `flow_files/*.flow` | `uipath-maestro-flow` |
| `.uipath/` or `app.config.json` | `uipath-coded-apps` |
| `.venv/` AND `pyproject.toml` with uipath dependency | `uipath-agents` |
| `project.json` only (no `.cs`/`.xaml`) | `uipath-rpa` |

**Multiple signals?** Go back to Step 2 and emit a multi-skill plan.

**No signals?** Use Step 1 answers. If still undetermined, plan with best available info and note the assumption.

## Step 4 — UI element targeting (only when the plan includes UI automation)

If the plan loads `uipath-rpa` for a workflow that clicks, types into, or reads elements in a desktop or browser app, ask the three UI questions in **one batched** `AskUserQuestion` call (see [pdd-driven-lane-guide.md → Step 5](pdd-driven-lane-guide.md#step-5--ui-element-targeting-only-when-9-contains-ui-applications) for the exact wording — same questions, same skip rules apply). Skip any question already resolved from the user's request.

Skip the entire batch for non-UI plans (pure data processing, API calls, agent-only, flow-only).

Record the answers in the plan header. The handoff is informational — `uipath-rpa` does not read the plan file; it runs its own target-configuration flow when invoked. The plan-header fields exist so the human reviewer and the main agent retain the decisions in context.

## Step 5 — Write the plan

Compose `<feature>.md` per the schema in [plan-and-tasks-format.md → Non-PDD lane](plan-and-tasks-format.md#non-pdd-lane-featuremd). Plan body holds the task list with the same task row schema as Lane A.

### Self-review before saving

1. **Coverage** — every requirement appears in at least one task.
2. **Placeholder scan** — no "TBD", "TODO", "as needed", "if appropriate", "similar to".
3. **Skill order** — correct specialist per task; skills load in the right order (e.g., RPA before platform deploy; testing before deploy).
4. **Validation gaps** — every generation task ends with a `Validate:` compile / build / lint check.
5. **Testing task present** — a dedicated `Testing (MANDATORY)` task exists for every generation skill in the plan. Routes to the specialist's testing references — does not describe the procedure.
6. **No internal-flow leakage** — the plan does not duplicate steps from any specialist's own references.
7. **Anti-hallucination rule** appended to every Skill prompt.

Fix issues before saving.

### Save location

Save as `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`:

- **Project directory exists** (`project.json`, `flow_files/`, `.uipath/`, or `pyproject.toml`) → save to `docs/plans/` within the project. Create the directory if needed.
- **No project directory** → save to `./plans/` (relative to the current working directory). Create the directory if needed.

### Resume handling

If a plan file already exists at the target path, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> A plan file already exists at `<path>`. How should I proceed?
>
> 1. **Continue with the current plan** *(recommended)* — pick up where you left off; checkbox state preserved
> 2. **Regenerate from the current request** — discard the current plan and rebuild

Option 1: read existing plan → recreate live `TaskCreate` calls with status preserved → done.
Option 2: parse the request fresh, run identity-matching against the old file (preserve completed work), write the new plan, emit live tasks. Same regenerate algorithm as Lane A — see [plan-and-tasks-format.md → Regenerate logic](plan-and-tasks-format.md#regenerate-logic-pdd-driven-lane-only).

## Step 6 — Present the plan

- **Explore first, then plan:** call `EnterPlanMode` with the plan content. User approves → `ExitPlanMode` → emit live `TaskCreate` calls.
- **Explore, plan, and execute simultaneously:** emit the plan as text. Then immediately emit live `TaskCreate` calls. Main agent starts executing.

## Lane B budget

Step 1 is **always one batched call** (Q1 + Q2 + optional Q3/Q4 in a single `AskUserQuestion`); Step 4 is one batched call when the plan has UI automation; resume adds one. The realistic floor is 0 calls and the realistic ceiling is 3.

| Scenario | `AskUserQuestion` calls |
|---|---|
| Simple single-skill, simultaneous, all signals clear, no UI | **0** (Step 1 fully resolved from context, no UI batch) |
| Non-trivial, no UI automation | **1** (Step 1 batched) |
| Non-trivial, with UI automation | **2** (Step 1 batched + Step 4 UI batch) |
| Vague request, with UI automation | **2** (Step 1 batched — Q3 is part of the same batch — + Step 4 UI batch) |
| Resume scenario | **+1** (continue/regenerate) |
| Realistic maximum | **3** |
| Hard cap (per-phase prompt budget, Critical Rules) | **5** |

The 5-call hard cap is defined in the planner's Critical Rules. If batching collapses the elicitation correctly, you should never approach it.
