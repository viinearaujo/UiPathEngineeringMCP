# SDD Generation Guide

Step-by-step instructions for transforming a PDD into an SDD. Follow the 3-phase interaction model described in SKILL.md.

## Phase 1 — PDD Analysis & Scope Selection

### Step 0: Determine Execution Mode & Delivery Model

Before reading the PDD, ask **one `AskUserQuestion` call containing two question objects** — execution mode and delivery model. Batching keeps the prompt budget flat: the delivery model gates every product decision (see [Product Selection Guide → Constraint Gate](product-selection-guide.md#constraint-gate)) and asking it later costs a second interruption.

**Delivery-model CLI preflight — run first, best-effort.** Before composing the questions, try to resolve the delivery model from the active CLI session:

```bash
uip login status --output json
```

Map `Data.BaseUrl`'s host:

| BaseUrl host | Record | Question 2 |
|---|---|---|
| `alpha.uipath.com`, `staging.uipath.com`, `cloud.uipath.com` | **cloud** | skip |
| any other (custom) host | **automation-suite**, version unknown | skip — apply the AS-version-unknown rule below |
| `Status` ≠ `Logged in`, call errors, or no `BaseUrl` | nothing | ask (leave as is) |

Precedence: an explicit user-stated delivery model or a PDD signal **wins over** the preflight — never override an explicit statement with the detected value. The preflight is **best-effort and never blocks** (Rule G-8): on any CLI failure, fall back to asking Question 2.

*Question 1 — Execution mode:*

> How should I handle this SDD generation?
>
> 1. **Autonomous** *(recommended)* — I will read the PDD, make all decisions, and generate the full SDD. I will only interrupt for hard blockers (PDD unreadable, Agent/Coded App missing critical info, unresolved `[SME REVIEW]` items before finalizing).
> 2. **Interactive** — I will pause at each phase checkpoint (summary, architecture, final SDD) for your review before proceeding.

*Question 2 — Delivery model:*

> Where will this automation run?
>
> 1. **UiPath Automation Cloud** — full product catalog available
> 2. **Automation Suite (self-hosted)** — product availability depends on the Suite version; I will gate recommendations accordingly
> 3. **Standalone Orchestrator (MSI)** — most restrictive; modern platform products unavailable
> 4. **Not sure** — I will proceed assuming Automation Cloud and flag the assumption as `[SME REVIEW]`

**Skip Question 2** when the delivery model is already resolved — the user's request states it, the PDD carries a delivery-model signal (see [PDD Analysis Guide → Environment & Constraint Signals](pdd-analysis-guide.md#environment--constraint-signals)), or the CLI preflight above resolved it. Record the resolved value instead of asking. If the answer is Automation Suite and the version is unknown, do not ask a follow-up — gate against the latest matrix column and add an `[SME REVIEW]` row for the version in §16 Deployment Environment.

**Skip Question 1 symmetrically** when the request already states the execution mode ("autonomous", "don't pause for checkpoints", "interactive review"). When both questions are resolved from context, skip the `AskUserQuestion` call entirely and record both values.

Record both choices — they go into the SDD's `## Planner Handoff` header (Phase 3 Step 2) and propagate to Lane A (task derivation): execution mode drives task review behavior; delivery model is passed to specialists as a platform constraint.

In **Autonomous** mode:
- Skip Phase 1 summary presentation (generate internally, do not wait for confirmation) — the `## Recommended Scope` block still persists into the SDD (Phase 3 Step 2 item 3)
- Skip Phase 2 architecture review (generate, do not wait)
- Still ask the SME Review resolution question before writing (Step 1.5) — this is a hard blocker
- Still ask the Agent/Coded App gap-filling question if triggered — this is a hard blocker
- **Insert a "Decisions Made" block** at the top of the SDD (immediately after the Planner Handoff header and before any other section) listing the five highest-leverage architectural picks with one-sentence reasons. See Phase 3 Step 2 item 3 for the exact block format. Do **NOT** use `AskUserQuestion` — the picks are decided autonomously; the block makes them scannable in the SDD's first screenful so a reviewer can spot a wrong call without reading the whole document.

In **Interactive** mode:
- Present and wait at every checkpoint as described in the steps below

### Step 0.5: Create Progress Tasks

Create progress-tracking tasks via `TaskCreate` so the user can see where the SDD generation stands.

```
TaskCreate: subject="Read PDD and extract data",        activeForm="Reading PDD…"
TaskCreate: subject="Select product",                    activeForm="Selecting product…"
TaskCreate: subject="Generate architecture (Phase 2)",   activeForm="Generating architecture…"
TaskCreate: subject="Generate full SDD (Phase 3)",       activeForm="Generating SDD sections…"
TaskCreate: subject="Resolve SME review items",          activeForm="Resolving SME review items…"
TaskCreate: subject="Write SDD to disk",                 activeForm="Writing SDD…"
```

Mark each task `in_progress` when starting and `completed` when done.

**Rule G-8 — Task creation is best-effort and never blocks SDD output.** If any `TaskCreate` or `TaskUpdate` call fails (tool unavailable, runtime error, timeout), log a single warning to the user, continue the SDD generation without progress tasks, and do not retry. The SDD file itself is the authoritative deliverable. Progress tasks are a UX convenience only.

> If Step 0.5 `TaskCreate` failed, silently skip every subsequent `Mark "X" as in_progress / as completed` instruction in this guide — the tasks do not exist to update, and a second warning to the user is noise.

These tasks track SDD generation. Implementation tasks are owned by Lane A (task derivation), which runs after Phase D writes the SDD — do NOT create implementation tasks here.

### Step 1: Read the PDD

> **Progress:** Mark "Read PDD and extract data" as `in_progress`.

1. Determine the input format (PDF, docx, markdown, pasted text).
2. **Size-based reading strategy** for PDFs:
   - **Under 10 pages:** read the entire document in one pass. Skip ToC lookup.
   - **10-50 pages:** read the ToC first, then read sections in priority order (overview → steps → exceptions → applications → credentials).
   - **Over 50 pages:** read ToC, then read high-priority sections (overview, process steps, exceptions) first, extract as you go, then read remaining sections.
3. For pasted text over 3000 words, ask the user to paste in sections.
4. **Docx handling:** .docx is a binary format — do NOT Read it directly or attempt to extract data from garbled output. Convert first. Run from the directory where the markdown should land (output defaults to the current working directory):

   ```bash
   bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/docx-extract.sh "<PDD_FILE_PATH>"
   ```

   `<SKILL_DIR>` is the folder containing this skill's SKILL.md; `<PDD_FILE_PATH>` is the full path to the .docx. The script produces a UTF-8 markdown file plus a `-media/` folder with embedded screenshots — Read both (screenshots feed the canonical-example extraction). Complex multi-paragraph tables may come out as raw HTML `<table>` blocks — parse them, they carry the same data. If the script reports pandoc missing, relay its install command to the user; only if the user cannot install pandoc, fall back to: "Please export the Word document as PDF or paste the content directly." Never drive Word via COM automation.
5. **Error cases:** if the document cannot be read (corrupt PDF, password-protected, unsupported format), tell the user and ask them to provide it in a different format. If the document does not appear to be a PDD (no process steps, no application details, no exception handling), tell the user and stop.
6. **Language handling:** if the PDD is not in English, use `AskUserQuestion` with the numbered-choice format:

   > The PDD appears to be in <LANGUAGE>. Which language should the SDD use?
   >
   > 1. **English** *(recommended)* — SDD in English for broadest tool compatibility
   > 2. **<LANGUAGE>** — SDD in the same language as the PDD

   Regardless of choice, keep section headings and structural identifiers (BR-01, B1, E1) in English for tool compatibility.

### Step 2: Extract Structured Information

Follow the [PDD Analysis Guide](pdd-analysis-guide.md) to extract data from the PDD. Build an internal model with these components:

| Component | PDD Topic to Look For | Required |
|---|---|---|
| Process name and objective | Introduction | Yes |
| Key contacts | Process key contacts | No |
| Process overview (schedule, volumes, FTEs) | Process overview | Yes |
| In-scope activities | In scope | Yes |
| Out-of-scope activities | Out of scope | Yes |
| Process steps | Detailed process map / steps | Yes |
| Business exceptions | Exceptions handling | Yes |
| System errors | Error mapping and handling | Yes |
| Application inventory | In-scope application details | Yes |
| Development prerequisites | Prerequisites for development | No |
| Credentials and assets | Credentials and asset management | Yes |
| Test data | Appendix | No |

**Key Contacts go into §1 Delivery Team.** The PDD's Key Contacts section (SA, BA, developers, PM, SME / Process Owner) populates the Delivery Team table in §1 of the RPA template. Include only roles the PDD explicitly names — do not invent or leave rows as `[SME REVIEW]`; omit silent rows instead.

### Step 2.5: Tenant Library Discovery

The org's deployed libraries cannot be inferred from any PDD. Query the tenant feed to discover candidates the new project should reference. Run in BOTH Autonomous and Interactive modes — this drives §14 Packages and §16 "Shared libraries referenced".

Skip this step for non-RPA primaries (Agents, Coded Apps, Flow, Case, API Workflows) — shared RPA libraries do not apply to those products' package models.

Run the procedure in [tenant-library-search-guide.md](tenant-library-search-guide.md). Keyword source for step 2: PDD Application Inventory + org-prefix terms (`Common`, `Shared`, `<Company>` if mentioned in the PDD). Output mapping: every selected library → one row in every sub-project's §14 Packages table, and its package ID into §16 Deployment Environment → "Shared libraries referenced". If the auth preflight fails, use the guide's manual fallback and propagate the user's named libraries to §14 / §16 the same way.

**This step is best-effort — it never blocks SDD output.** If the auth preflight errors or auth is unavailable, **Autonomous mode skips library discovery and proceeds with public NuGet only** — do not retry or troubleshoot auth mid-generation, and do not pause. Skip the step entirely if the user's prompt forbids running `uip` commands.

### Step 3: Detect Gaps

Scan for missing or vague information. Use the Gap Detection Checklist in the [PDD Analysis Guide](pdd-analysis-guide.md) to classify each gap as `[DEFAULT]` or `[SME REVIEW]`.

### Step 4: Run Levels in Order

> **Progress:** Mark "Read PDD and extract data" as `completed`. Mark "Select product" as `in_progress`.

This step orchestrates four levels of decision. Each level lives in its own canonical reference; this guide does not restate them. Run in order — output of each level feeds the next.

> **Constraint Gate applies at every level.** The delivery model from Step 0 and any user-stated product exclusions filter the candidates before each level recommends — see [Product Selection Guide → Constraint Gate](product-selection-guide.md#constraint-gate) and [platform-availability-guide.md](platform-availability-guide.md).

| Level | Decision | Canonical reference | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Level 1** | Primary scope (Agents / Coded Apps / API Workflows / Case / Flow / RPA / Solution) | [Product Selection Guide → Level 1](product-selection-guide.md#level-1--primary-scope-selection) | Always |
| **Level 1.5** | RPA sub-type (Process / Library / Test Automation) | [RPA Product Guide → Level 1.5](rpa-product-guide.md#level-15--rpa-sub-type-selection) | Run when Level 1 = RPA. For Solution composition with RPA projects, defer to Pass C of Level 1.75. |
| **Level 1.75** | Solution composition (which products and how many) | [Product Selection Guide → Level 1.75](product-selection-guide.md#level-175--solution-composition) | Run when Level 1 = Solution OR user picks "Solution (customize)" in Step 6 |
| **Level 2.5 Part A** | RPA decomposition (Single vs Master Project) | [RPA Product Guide → Level 2.5 Part A](rpa-product-guide.md#level-25-part-a--rpa-decomposition-signals) | Run for every RPA Process project in the scope |
| **Level 2.5 Part B** | Merge into unified project list | [Product Selection Guide → Level 2.5 Part B](product-selection-guide.md#part-b--merge-into-the-final-project-list) | Always — produces the canonical project list |

This step's output goes into the Phase 1 summary at Step 6 and drives the Phase 2 architectural core.

> Level 2 (Authoring mode — XAML / Coded / Hybrid) is decided per RPA project at Phase 2 Step 2 from [RPA Product Guide → Level 2](rpa-product-guide.md#level-2--authoring-mode). Level 3 (Capability add-ons — HITL, Integration Service, etc.) is detected during PDD analysis and flagged in template sections during Phase 2 Step 4.

### Step 5: Check for Agent/Coded App Gaps

If the primary product is **Agents** or **Coded Apps** AND required product-specific information is missing from the PDD, follow the Gap Handling flow in the [Product Selection Guide](product-selection-guide.md). All questions use the numbered-choice format.

Summary:
1. Ask the user: proceed with gap-filling or use a different product?
2. If proceed → batch 4-6 gap-filling questions (Agents: framework, tools, memory, evaluation, bindings. Coded Apps: framework, app type, pages, state, caller)
3. If different product → ask which fallback (RPA Process, Maestro Flow, Case Management, Stop)
4. Re-run Step 4 with fallback, or end if "Stop"

Never auto-fallback. The user must choose explicitly.

### Step 6: Present Summary + Scope Recommendation

Emit the summary block described in "Presenting the Recommendation" in the [Product Selection Guide](product-selection-guide.md). The **recommended scope appears first**; single-product alternatives and "Solution (customize)" follow as alternatives in the confirmation `AskUserQuestion` call.

```markdown
## PDD Analysis Summary

**Process:** <PROCESS_NAME>
**Objective:** <OBJECTIVE_SUMMARY>
**Applications:** <APP_COUNT> — <APP_NAME (ROLE)>, ...
**Process Steps:** <STEP_COUNT> steps identified across <APP_COUNT> applications
**Business Rules:** <RULE_COUNT> extracted
**Business Exceptions:** <EXCEPTION_COUNT> defined in PDD
**System Errors:** <ERROR_COUNT> defined in PDD
**Gaps Detected:** <DEFAULT_COUNT> [DEFAULT], <SME_REVIEW_COUNT> [SME REVIEW]

<RECOMMENDED_SCOPE_SUMMARY_BLOCK — emit the "Summary block" from
product-selection-guide.md → Presenting the Recommendation:
Recommended Scope + Project List + Queue Architecture>

### Clarifying Questions
<NUMBERED_QUESTIONS_IF_ANY>
```

Then call `AskUserQuestion` with the confirmation question from the Product Selection Guide's "Presenting the Recommendation" section (recommendation as option 1, single-product alternatives, then "Solution (customize)").

**If the user picks "Solution (customize)":** re-run Level 1.75 per the customize branch in the guide, then re-emit this summary with the customized project list, then re-ask the confirmation question. Max 3 revisions — after that, proceed with the latest composition.

**If the user picks a single-product alternative:** re-run Step 4 with the user's choice as the forced primary (including Level 1.5 if it's RPA).

Ask at most 5 clarifying questions total, in a single round. If the user cannot answer some, tag those items as `[SME REVIEW]` and proceed.

## Phase 2 — Architecture Review

> **Progress:** Mark "Select product" as `completed`. Mark "Generate architecture (Phase 2)" as `in_progress`.

### Step 1: Load the Template(s)

Load from the [Template Mapping table in the Product Selection Guide](product-selection-guide.md#template-mapping):

- **Single-product scope:** load the one template matching the Level 1 primary.
- **Solution scope:** load the solution overview structure PLUS one template per project in the Level 2.5 unified project list. RPA Master Projects share one RPA template file across their sub-projects; unrelated RPA projects each get their own file.

### Step 2: Generate the Architectural Core

The architectural core sections differ per template. For each product, generate these sections in Phase 2:

**RPA (Process / Library / Test Automation):**
- §5 Data Definitions (C# records or dictionary tables per §13 Implementation Mode)
- §9 Application Inventory (flag Integration Service connectors, specify email protocol)
- §10 Master Project Architecture (apply Level 2.5 Part A from [rpa-product-guide.md](rpa-product-guide.md#level-25-part-a--rpa-decomposition-signals) — Single vs Master Project, sub-projects, queue schema)
- §11 Project Structure (per sub-project if Master Project: project type, framework, folder layout, workflow inventory) — the most load-bearing SDD section: Lane A derives tasks from it
- §12 Queue Architecture (Master Project only — queue definitions, item schemas, processing rules)
- §13 Implementation Mode (XAML / Coded / Hybrid — apply Level 2 from [rpa-product-guide.md](rpa-product-guide.md#level-2--authoring-mode))
- §14 Packages (infer NuGet packages from §9 Application Inventory and process steps)

**Maestro Flow:**
- §3 Nodes Inventory (with node type per node)
- §4 Variables (direction, type)
- §5 Subflows (if any)
- §7 Integrated Components (RPA, Agents, API Workflows, Connectors, HITL touchpoints)
- §9 Project Structure

**Case Management:**
- §3 Stages
- §4 Tasks Grid (per stage, lanes × index)
- §7 Data Definitions (case data objects, supporting objects, data flow)
- §13 Task Type Registry (RPA / AGENT / API_WORKFLOW / CONNECTOR / HITL)
- §14 Integrated Components
- §15 Project Structure

**Agents:**
- §2 Agent Framework (LangGraph / LlamaIndex / OpenAI Agents / Simple Function)
- §3 Tools
- §4 Memory / RAG
- §6 Orchestrator Bindings
- §9 Project Structure (Coded vs Low-code)

**Coded Apps:**
- §2 App Type & Tech Stack
- §3 Pages & Routes
- §4 Components
- §5 State Management
- §6 API Integration
- §10 Project Structure

**API Workflows:**
- §2 Input Schema
- §3 Output Schema
- §4 Execution Flow (high-level steps, no JavaScript)
- §5 Connectors & External Calls
- §10 Project Structure

### Step 3: Decompose Steps Into Implementation Units

Each template has a primary inventory table. Map PDD steps to units:

| Product | Primary Inventory | Unit Type |
|---|---|---|
| RPA (Single Project) | Workflow Inventory | `.xaml` or `.cs` workflow files |
| RPA (Master Project) | Workflow Inventory **per sub-project** | `.xaml` or `.cs` workflow files, grouped by sub-project |
| Flow | Nodes Inventory | Flow nodes |
| Case | Tasks Grid | Tasks per lane/index |
| Agents | Tools | Python functions, RPA/API workflow bindings |
| Coded Apps | Pages + Components | Routes and React/Angular/Vue components |
| API Workflows | Execution Flow steps | Activities (HTTP, Connector, Script) |

Each unit must have: **a concrete responsibility, specific PDD step references, and defined inputs/outputs.**

**For RPA Master Project:** decompose in two passes:
1. First, assign each PDD step to a sub-project based on the §10 sub-projects table (each sub-project lists its PDD steps).
2. Then, within each sub-project, decompose the assigned steps into workflow files.
3. For REFramework sub-projects, the main workflows (Init, GetTransactionData, Process, SetTransactionStatus) come from the framework — only the Process-specific workflows go in the inventory.

### Step 4: Flag Integrated Components

For each integrated component detected in Phase 1, flag it in the appropriate section of the template:

- **HITL** (Flow / Maestro / Agent only) → flag touchpoints in nodes/agent description; implementation task will route to `uipath-human-in-the-loop` skill
- **Integration Service connectors** → list in Application Inventory (RPA) or Connectors section (others); implementation task will route to `uipath-platform`
- **RPA processes called by Flow/Agent/Case** → list in Integrated Components section; implementation task will create the RPA project
- **API Workflows called by Flow/Agent/Case** → list in Integrated Components section; implementation task will create the API Workflow project

### Step 5: Present Architecture for Review

Present the architectural core to the user. Wait for approval or adjustments.

**Approval criteria:** any response without specific change requests. Responses like "looks good", "ok", "proceed", "yes", or a topic change all count as approval. If the user requests specific changes, incorporate them and re-present the architecture (max 3 revisions — after that, proceed with the latest version and tag disagreements as `[SME REVIEW]`).

## Phase 3 — Full SDD Generation

> **Progress:** Mark "Generate architecture (Phase 2)" as `completed`. Mark "Generate full SDD (Phase 3)" as `in_progress`.

> **Write early, append incrementally — the file on disk is the deliverable.** Do NOT hold the entire SDD in context and write only at the very end. As soon as Phase 2 has produced the architectural core, write a first valid file: the header + `## Planner Handoff` header **and** the `<!-- planner-handoff:v1 -->` marker + `## Decisions Made` block (autonomous) + the Phase 1 / Phase 2 sections you already have. Then append the remaining Phase 3 sections to that file with follow-up `Edit`/`Write` calls. Rationale: a long autonomous turn can hit the per-turn watchdog mid-generation — an incrementally-written file leaves a gradeable, useful SDD on disk instead of nothing. The Planner Handoff header + marker MUST be in this first write so detection (and grading) works even on a partial file. Step 1.5 (SME resolution) and the Step 2 superset check still run; they patch and verify the already-on-disk file rather than gating the first write.

### Step 1: Generate Remaining Sections

Fill in all sections of the chosen template not covered in Phase 1 or Phase 2. Section assignments per phase:

**Phase 1 produces (for all templates):**
- Header & Document History (process name, today's date, version 1.0)
- Overview section (§1)
- Process/Flow/Lifecycle diagram (§2 for most templates)
- Detailed steps / nodes description where applicable

**Phase 2 produces:** See Phase 2 Step 2 above (template-specific architectural core)

**Phase 3 produces:** All remaining sections — typically:
- Business Rules (RPA, Case)
- Value Mappings (RPA)
- Exception / Error Handling (all)
- Credentials & Assets (RPA)
- Deployment Environment (RPA — robot type, Studio/Robot versions, VM hosts, screen resolution, scalability). Fill the Orchestrator row from the Step 0 delivery model (Cloud / Automation Suite + version / standalone); fill `[SME REVIEW]` for the rest when the PDD does not specify — these fields typically come from the deployment team, not the PDD. Never invent VM names, version pins, or robot types.
- Triggers (Flow)
- SLA Rules & Escalations (Case)
- Compliance Constraints (Case)
- Roles & RACI Matrix (Case)
- Evaluation Criteria (Agents)
- **Testing Strategy — always thorough.** Cover happy path, edge cases, error scenarios, and (for Master Projects) end-to-end pipeline tests. Do NOT ask the user about test depth — depth is non-negotiable here. Implementation specialists may scope tests down at execution time if the user wants a quick MVP.
- **Next Steps — points at Lane A (task derivation).** Replaces the legacy "Implementation Plan" section. Lane A owns the implementation task list; Phase D does not generate one.

> **What Phase 3 does NOT produce:** an Implementation Plan section, a task list, or `TaskCreate` calls for implementation work. Those are owned by Lane A (task derivation). The SDD's `## Next Steps` section marks the boundary into Lane A, and that is the entire Phase D output surface.

### Step 1.5: Resolve SME Review Items

> **Progress:** Mark "Generate full SDD (Phase 3)" as `completed`. Mark "Resolve SME review items" as `in_progress`.

Before writing the SDD, collect all `[SME REVIEW]` items. If there are any:

> **Batching rule — `AskUserQuestion` 4-option cap.** Each `AskUserQuestion` question accepts at most 4 options. If there are 1-4 items, send one question. If there are 5-8 items, send a single `AskUserQuestion` call with **two questions** (each ≤4 options), grouped by SDD section. If there are more than 8 items, send one `AskUserQuestion` call per batch of up to 8 (two questions each), waiting for answers between batches. **Do not flatten >4 items into one question** — the call will fail validation.

1. Batch them into one or more `AskUserQuestion` calls using numbered-choice format. Example for 1-4 items:

> Before I finalize the SDD, these items need your input:
>
> 1. **<ITEM_NAME>** (<SDD_SECTION>) — <QUESTION>. Default: `<DEFAULT_VALUE>`
> 2. **<ITEM_NAME>** (<SDD_SECTION>) — <QUESTION>. Default: `<DEFAULT_VALUE>`
>
> You can answer each, accept all defaults by replying "use defaults", or skip specific items.

2. Update the SDD sections with the user's answers.
3. If the user partially answers or asks follow-ups, do one more round (max 2 rounds total). After 2 rounds, keep remaining unresolved items as `[SME REVIEW]` and proceed to Step 2.
4. Any items the user explicitly skips remain as `[SME REVIEW]` in the final file (should be rare).
5. If there are zero `[SME REVIEW]` items, skip this step entirely.

This step runs in BOTH Autonomous and Interactive modes — it is a hard blocker to producing a complete SDD.

### Step 2: Write the SDD File(s)

> **Progress:** Mark "Resolve SME review items" as `completed`. Mark "Write SDD to disk" as `in_progress`.

1. Assemble all sections in template order. If you followed the write-early principle above, the file already holds the header + handoff + Phase 1/2 sections — finalize it by appending/patching the remaining sections in template order rather than rewriting from scratch.
2. **Fill the `## Planner Handoff` header** that appears in every template after `## Document History`. This is the load-bearing detection contract. The Entry Guard accepts **either** the heading OR the adjacent `<!-- planner-handoff:v1 -->` HTML marker as a detection signal — both ship in every template and both should survive into the generated file (so a later session, or a hand-written SDD, still routes to Lane A):

   ```markdown
   <!-- DO NOT RENAME: uipath-planner detects SDDs via this exact heading or the marker below. -->
   <!-- planner-handoff:v1 -->
   ## Planner Handoff

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | **Execution autonomy** | <autonomous | interactive>          ← from Phase 1 Step 0
   | **Delivery model** | <cloud | automation-suite | standalone | unspecified> ← from Phase 1 Step 0 (append the Suite version when known, e.g. `automation-suite 2025.1`)
   | **SDD scope** | <single-product | solution>                  ← from Phase 1 Step 4 (Level 1 / Level 1.75)
   | **Project list section** | §11 / §10 + §11 / Project Inventory ← template-specific (RPA single: §11; RPA Master: §10 + §11; Flow: §3 + §7; etc.)
   | **Tasks file** | `<PROCESS_NAME_KEBAB>-tasks.md`             ← planner writes here on first run
   | **Generated by** | uipath-planner
   | **Generation date** | <YYYY-MM-DD>
   ```

   Do NOT rename the heading or strip the marker. They are redundant on purpose — keeping both means a hand-edit of one signal does not silently break Lane A detection.

3. **Autonomous-mode Decisions Made block.** If `Execution autonomy: autonomous`, insert a `## Decisions Made` block immediately after the Planner Handoff header and before any `Action Required — SME Review Items` block or the Table of Contents. The block makes the five highest-leverage architectural picks scannable in the SDD's first screenful so a reviewer can spot a wrong call without reading the whole document. In `Execution autonomy: interactive`, this block is optional — the user already reviewed each decision at the Phase 1/Phase 2 checkpoints. Skip the block for interactive runs.

   Format:

   ```markdown
   ## Decisions Made

   > Autonomous mode picked the five architectural decisions below without a user checkpoint. Override by rerunning in Interactive mode (`Execution autonomy: interactive` in the Planner Handoff header above) or by editing the relevant SDD section.

   | # | Decision | Picked | One-sentence reason |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 1 | **Platform constraints** (Constraint Gate) | <DELIVERY_MODEL; BLOCKED_PRODUCTS_WITH_ALTERNATIVES_OR_NONE> | <SOURCE_OF_DELIVERY_MODEL_AND_MATRIX_RULE_APPLIED> |
   | 2 | **Scope** (Level 1) | <SINGLE_PRODUCT_OR_SOLUTION_COMPOSITION> | <REASON_TIED_TO_PDD_SIGNAL> |
   | 3 | **RPA sub-type** (Level 1.5) — per RPA project | <PROCESS_OR_LIBRARY_OR_TEST_AUTOMATION> | <REASON_TIED_TO_PDD_SIGNAL> |
   | 4 | **Authoring mode** (Level 2) — per RPA project | <XAML_OR_CODED_OR_HYBRID> | <REASON_TIED_TO_PROCESS_BODY_SHAPE> |
   | 5 | **Framework** — per RPA Process project | <REFRAMEWORK_OR_SEQUENCE> | <REASON_TIED_TO_PER_ITEM_INDEPENDENCE> |
   ```

   Rules for the block:
   - Each "Picked" cell is a single concrete value, not a placeholder.
   - Each "One-sentence reason" is ≤ 20 words and cites the PDD signal or process characteristic that drove the pick.
   - Row 1 always appears, even when nothing was blocked (`cloud; no products blocked`) — the reviewer must see which platform the architecture assumes.
   - For Solution scope, rows 3-5 repeat per RPA project (use a sub-table or one row per project — keep concise).
   - For non-RPA scopes (e.g., Single-product Agent), rows 3-5 collapse to N/A with one row covering the product-specific Level-1.5-equivalent (framework choice, app type, etc.).
   - The block does NOT replace the per-section detail later in the SDD — §10 / §11 / §13 still carry the full justification. The block is the **scannable index** of those decisions.

   In BOTH modes, also emit the `## Recommended Scope` block directly after `## Decisions Made` (directly after the Planner Handoff header when that block is absent — interactive runs): copy the Phase 1 summary's `Recommendation:`, `Delivery model:`, and `Blocked by platform:` lines (see [product-selection-guide.md → Summary block](product-selection-guide.md#summary-block)). Autonomous mode skips the Phase 1 presentation, so this copy is the only durable record of the Constraint Gate outcome.

4. If any `[SME REVIEW]` items remain, add a consolidated warning section after the Planner Handoff header (and after the `## Decisions Made` / `## Recommended Scope` blocks if present) and before the Table of Contents:

```markdown
## Action Required — SME Review Items

| # | Section | Item | Question |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | <SECTION> | <ITEM> | <QUESTION> |

> These items are marked `[SME REVIEW]` in the document. The automation can be built with defaults, but these must be verified before production.
```

5. **Target SDD length: 300-800 lines of markdown** for single-project SDDs. **Master Project SDDs may reach 600-1200 lines** due to per-sub-project structure sections — this is expected. For processes with more than 20 steps, group related steps and summarize at the parent level. For processes with more than 10 business rules, prioritize the 10 most impactful.
6. **Re-run handling.** If `<PROCESS_NAME_KEBAB>-sdd.md` already exists, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

   > An SDD already exists at `<sdd-path>`. How should I proceed?
   >
   > 1. **Keep the existing SDD and stop** *(recommended)* — proceed to Lane A if you want to refresh the task list
   > 2. **Regenerate from the PDD** — overwrites the existing SDD
   > 3. **Generate alongside as `<name>-v2-sdd.md`** — for diffing

   Default is "keep" — overwriting an SDD the user might have hand-edited is the more destructive action.

7. Write the output file(s) to the current working directory. If the user specified an output path for the SDD, use it instead of these defaults:
   - **Single-product scope:** one file at `<PROCESS_NAME_KEBAB>-sdd.md`.
   - **Solution scope:** the solution overview at `<SOLUTION_NAME_KEBAB>-solution-sdd.md` PLUS one per-project SDD at `<PROJECT_NAME_KEBAB>-sdd.md` for each project in the unified project list. Put the `[SME REVIEW]` warning block in the solution overview AND in any per-project file where a review item lives in that project. Each per-project SDD gets its own `## Planner Handoff` header.

8. **Template-superset check (mandatory before the item 9 summary).** After writing each SDD file, re-read it and extract every H2 (`## `) and H3 (`### `) heading. Compare against the template's Table of Contents and required subsections. The generated SDD's heading set MUST be a superset — extra subsections are fine, missing template sections are an SDD defect.

   Minimum required H2 headings per template:
   - **RPA template:** §1 Process Overview, §2 Process Map, §3 Detailed Process Steps, §4 Business Rules, §5 Data Definitions, §6 Value Mappings, §7 Exception Handling, §8 Error Handling, §9 Application Inventory, §10 Master Project Architecture, §11 Project Structure, §12 Queue Architecture (Master Project only — may be omitted for Single Project), §13 Implementation Mode, §14 Packages, §15 Credentials & Assets, §16 Deployment Environment, §17 Testing Strategy, §18 Next Steps
   - **Other templates:** check the template file's TOC; the rule is the same — every H2 in the template appears in the generated SDD.

   For any missing required H2:
   1. Regenerate that section from the template + Phase 1 extraction data + Phase 2 architecture.
   2. If the template's contents for that section depend on a Phase 1 / Phase 2 input that is genuinely absent (e.g. §4 Business Rules but the PDD has zero rule signals), emit the section with an explicit "No business rules extracted from the PDD" note plus an `[SME REVIEW]` row asking the user to supply any.
   3. Never silently drop a section.

   Common slip-fail: skipping §4 Business Rules because the PDD has no dedicated "Business Rules" section. Rules are usually buried in "Remarks", step descriptions, or screenshots — the PDD analysis guide's "Embedded business rules" pointer applies. Treat zero rules in §4 as a regeneration trigger, not a finished section.

9. Output a summary in the conversation:

```markdown
## SDD Generated

<FILENAME_1> — <COUNT> sections, <LINE_COUNT> lines
<FILENAME_2> — <COUNT> sections, <LINE_COUNT> lines
...

<SME_REVIEW_COUNT> unresolved SME review items (if any — list them).

**Next:** Phase D is complete and the SDD is on disk. Lane A (task derivation) continues on the next turn with this SDD path — it derives the task list and emits live `TaskCreate` calls.
```

### Step 2.5: Word (.docx) Delivery — only when requested

When the user asks for a Word or client-facing deliverable, convert the written SDD — do not author Word content by hand or drive Word via COM.

**Plain `.docx` of the SDD:**

```bash
bash <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/sdd-to-docx.sh "<SDD_PATH>.md" [--reference-doc "<TEMPLATE>.docx"]
```

`--reference-doc` applies a customer template's fonts, heading styles, and margins. The section structure stays as the markdown SDD.

**Official client SDD/ASDD (customer's structure):** the markdown SDD is agent-first; the official Word document is the client deliverable in the customer's own section layout. Ask the user for the template path, then follow [asdd-crosswalk-guide.md](asdd-crosswalk-guide.md) to match the markdown SDD into the template's sections and compute the missing pieces. Do not invent the official section structure.

**Diagrams:** keep them as Mermaid and make them readable — clear node labels, one node per step, a logical direction. They convert as code blocks. Rendering them to images and styling the final document are not this skill's job — leave that to the user or their doc tooling.

If the script reports pandoc missing, relay its install command.

Skip this step entirely when the user did not ask for Word output.

### Step 3: Proceed to Lane A (Task Derivation)

> **Progress:** Mark "Write SDD to disk" as `completed`. All progress tasks are now done.

The SDD is the deliverable of Phase D. **Do not generate an Implementation Plan section inside the SDD. Do not create implementation `TaskCreate` calls during Phase D. Do not start executing.**

> **The SDD write is a turn boundary — do not begin Lane A in the same turn as Phase D.** Once the SDD is on disk, the superset check has passed, and the Step 2 item 9 summary is emitted, that is the end of the current turn. Continue into Lane A on the **next** turn. Rationale: Phase D (read PDD + guides, author §1–§18) and Lane A (parse SDD, derive tasks, emit `TaskCreate`) are each heavy; stacking both in one unbroken autonomous turn is what pushes wall-clock past the per-turn watchdog and loses the whole run. Yielding after a durable SDD write keeps each turn bounded and guarantees the SDD is graded before any further work. This is a turn checkpoint, **not** an `AskUserQuestion` — do not prompt the user; simply let the turn end after the summary.

Then continue based on the user's intent:

- If the user's intent implies implementation ("create / build / implement / set up / make") → on the next turn, continue into Lane A with `<sdd-path>`. Lane A reads the `## Planner Handoff` header you wrote, derives tasks, writes `<process-kebab>-tasks.md` alongside the SDD, and emits live tasks routing to specialist skills — see [pdd-driven-lane-guide.md](pdd-driven-lane-guide.md).
- If the user only asked to "design / architect / generate an SDD" → stop here; the SDD is enough.
