## Downstream CLI compatibility

The skill emits the `23.0.0` top-level shape (`{ id, version, name, metadata, bindings, variables, nodes, edges, layout }`). Phase-specific downstream caveats:

| Phase | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 2 — Prototyping | Informational validate, no halt on errors. |
| 4 — Validate | Authoritative — `uip maestro case validate` accepts the top-level shape. Retry-and-fix on failure, 3-retry cap, hard stop on 3rd failure. |
| 5 — Debug | Before the AskUserQuestion, print plain-text warning: `> uip maestro case debug may reject the top-level shape. Failure does not invalidate caseplan.json.` On failure, note `caveat: CLI may reject schema — failure may be schema-related not case-bug-related` in build-issues.md. |
| 6 — Publish | Before the AskUserQuestion, print plain-text warning: `> uip solution upload may reject the top-level shape until the CLI catches up. Failure non-fatal — caseplan.json still valid.` On failure, dump response to `tasks/upload-response.json`, re-show Phase 6 prompt. |

Skill stays emit-honest: JSON-shape correctness is the skill's job, downstream CLI accept-correctness is outside scope.

## Why phased

After `tasks.md` is approved, skill does **not** build full case in one pass. It builds **placeholder** first (Phase 2 Prototyping) — enough structure for user to review case graph visually in Studio Web — then hard-stops for approval before wiring detail (Phase 3 Implementation). Validate (Phase 4), Debug (Phase 5), and Publish (Phase 6) each follow as separate gated phases. Debug runs before Publish so the user only publishes a build they've verified end-to-end.

Each hard stop gives user review checkpoint before agent commits to costly downstream work.

## Phase summary

| Phase | What gets built | Output | Hard stop on exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2 — Prototyping** | Solution + project, root case, global variables, stages, triggers (full), tasks (name + type, no value binding), placeholder tasks for unresolved | `caseplan.json` emitted; placeholder-profile validate run (structural errors only) | `Publish for review` / `Skip publish and continue` / `Abort` |
| **3 — Implementation** | Connector task schemas, task I/O value binding, conditions (all 4 scopes), SLA + escalation | `caseplan.json` ready for authoritative validation | None — proceeds to Phase 4 |
| **4 — Validate** | Run authoritative `uip maestro case validate`, dump `build-issues.md` | `caseplan.json` passes full validation | On 3rd validate failure: `Retry with fix` / `Pause for manual edit` / `Abort` |
| **5 — Debug** | Optional CLI debug run (real execution — emails, API calls, etc.) | Debug output streamed | `Run debug session` / `Skip to Publish` |
| **6 — Publish** | Optional Studio Web upload | `DesignerUrl` printed | `Publish to Studio Web` / `Done` |

## Phase 2 — Prototyping

### Structural nodes (full detail)

- Solution + project scaffolding (`uip solution init`, `uip solution project add`, plus JSON scaffolding from `plugins/case/impl-json.md`).
- Root case — `caseplan.json` with top-level fields + `metadata` block populated (name, `metadata.caseIdentifier`, empty `nodes[]`, empty `edges[]`).
- Global variables and arguments — variables block (`inputs`, `outputs`, `inputOutputs`) fully declared at top-level `variables`.
- Stages — all StageIds generated and captured.
- Edges — none authored; `schema.edges` stays `[]`. Stage transitions are condition-driven (written in Phase 3).
- Triggers — fully built. Trigger output mappings written (they reference global variables, which already exist).
- Entry-points input/output — `entry-points.json` `input`/`output` schemas refreshed from the declared In/Out arguments (Step 6.3, per [entry-points-sync.md](entry-points-sync.md)). Makes the Phase-2 publish-for-review contract correct; idempotent.

### Tasks (shape depends on resolution state + task class)

| Task class | Resolved resources | Phase 2 shape |
|---|---|---|
| Non-connector (`process`, `agent`, `rpa`, `action`, `api-workflow`, `case-management`, `wait-for-timer`) | `task-type-id` resolved | Full `data.inputs[]` schema written (from `uip maestro case tasks describe`). Each input's `value` field is empty (`""`). Outputs and task-specific scalar fields (e.g. `action`'s `taskTitle`/`priority`/`recipient`/`labels`) populated per plugin — these are final at Step 2; only input `value`s defer to Phase 3. |
| Connector (`connector-activity`, `connector-trigger`) | `type-id` + `connection-id` resolved | `data.typeId` + `data.connectionId` set. `data.inputs` omitted or empty. **No `case spec` call in Phase 2** — schema discovery is deferred to Phase 3. |
| Any task | Unresolved (`<UNRESOLVED: …>` in `tasks.md`) | Placeholder task per Rule 8 of `SKILL.md` — empty `data: {}` (plus `data.taskTitle` / `data.priority` / `data.recipient` for `action`). Marker preserved. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md). |
| `agent` / `api-workflow` built inline | Built + bound in Phase 1 at the Rule 17 gate | **Not a placeholder** — fully resolved task (name+folder binding, `resourceKey="solution_folder.<name>"`, **`folderPath` binding `default` = `""`** — co-located runtime folder; `solution_folder` stays only in `resourceKey`). Phase 2 treats it like any resolved resource. See [registry-discovery.md § Create-on-Missing](registry-discovery.md#create-on-missing-build-and-rediscovery). |

### What does NOT get written in Phase 2

- Task input `value` bindings (literals, expressions, cross-task references).
- Connector task input/output schemas.
- Conditions of any scope (stage-entry, stage-exit, task-entry, case-exit).
- SLA rules (default, conditional) and escalation rules.

### Phase 2 informational validate

End of Phase 2 mutations, run placeholder-profile validate:

```bash
uip maestro case validate "<caseplan.json path>" --skeleton --output json
```

`--skeleton` runs structural checks only (nodes, edges, identity, types, topology). Skips tasks, SLAs, escalations, and entry/exit rules — all unbound at this gate, filled in Phase 3.

**Informational — do NOT halt on errors or warnings.** Capture error and warning counts (and optionally first few messages); include in hard-stop summary. Errors that remain are structural (unreachable/orphan stage, missing trigger, duplicate names) and meaningful — user inspects via the existing `Abort` option before continuing.

### Phase 2 hard stop

**Unconditional.** Present summary, then prompt via AskUserQuestion. Prompt is MANDATORY on every run — auto mode, non-interactive mode, prior blanket approval do NOT bypass. Only valid transition out of Phase 2 is user response. If harness refuses interactive prompts, halt with explicit error rather than proceeding silently.

#### Summary content

Print before prompt:

1. Counts: stages / primary stages / secondary stages / triggers / tasks total / placeholder tasks / unresolved resources.
2. Validate result (placeholder-profile): `<N> errors, <M> warnings` — remaining errors are structural (unreachable/orphan stage, missing trigger, duplicate names) and actionable. Surfacing counts is enough; do not dump full error list unless user asks.
3. Paths: `caseplan.json`, `tasks.md`, `registry-resolved.json`.

Do not enumerate every task. Studio Web visualization fills that role after publish.

#### Prompt

Use **AskUserQuestion** with three options:

- `Publish for review` — upload skeleton to Studio Web for visual review.
- `Skip publish and continue` — proceed directly to Phase 3.
- `Abort` — stop the skill; leave artifacts in place.

#### On `Publish for review`

1. Run `uip solution resources refresh --solution-folder "<SolutionDir>" --output json` then `uip solution upload "<SolutionDir>" --output json`. Capture full upload response.
2. Parse `DesignerUrl` from response.
3. **MUST emit DesignerUrl as plain-text output to user BEFORE invoking AskUserQuestion**, on its own line:
   `Skeleton published. Review at: <DesignerUrl>`
   Never bundle URL only into question body — some renderers display question before surrounding prose, leaving user without URL until after they answer.
4. Only after URL line emitted, invoke **AskUserQuestion** (second prompt): `Continue to phase 3` / `Abort`.

If `DesignerUrl` missing from response, dump full upload response to `tasks/upload-response.json`, print path, continue to prompt — user can recover URL from file.

Do not warn user about Studio Web edits being overwritten. Phase 6's re-publish (when chosen) overwrites volatile review-time edits with final local state. User can compare Studio Web state before and after Phase 3 to spot edits they want to preserve.

#### On `Skip publish and continue`

Proceed directly to Phase 3.

#### On `Abort`

1. Dump in-memory issue list to `tasks/build-issues.md` per [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md).
2. Print paths of `caseplan.json`, `tasks.md`, `registry-resolved.json`, and solution directory.
3. Exit skill.

Do **not** delete artifacts. User may want to inspect them, or re-run skill later (regenerates `tasks.md` from scratch per Rule 6).

## Phase 3 — Implementation

### Re-entry protocol

Phase 3 begins after user selects `Continue to phase 3` (or `Skip publish and continue`). Before executing any Phase 3 step:

1. **Re-read `tasks.md`** — per Rule 7. Declarative plan is the handoff.
2. **Re-read `caseplan.json`** — authoritative source of all IDs generated in Phase 2:
   - Stage name → StageId (from `schema.nodes[]` where `type === "case-management:Stage"`, keyed on `data.label`; secondary stages are the same type with `data.stageType === "secondary"`).
   - Trigger ID (from `schema.nodes[]` where `type === "case-management:Trigger"`).
   - Task name → TaskId per stage (from `schema.nodes[<stage>].data.tasks[][]`).
   - Variable name → `var` ID (from top-level `variables.{inputs,outputs,inputOutputs}`).
3. Optionally cross-check against `id-map.json` if JSON-strategy plugins wrote one. `caseplan.json` is source of truth; `id-map.json` is speed-up.

Never trust in-memory maps from Phase 2 without re-reading `caseplan.json` — context may be compacted across hard stop.

### Phase 3 — Execution order

After re-entry:

1. **Connector task detail** — for each connector task in `tasks.md`, run plugin's `impl-json.md` detail steps: `case spec --type {activity,trigger} --input-details`, then mint `data.context[]` / `data.inputs[]` / `data.outputs[]` from the populated `caseShape` (placeholder substitution + var/id minting).
2. **Task I/O value binding (all task classes)** — per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md). Applies to both non-connector and connector tasks. For each task's inputs in `tasks.md` order, write literal, expression, or cross-task reference (resolved to `=vars.<var>`) into `task.data.inputs[i].value`. Connector tasks have `data.inputs[]` schema written in step 1; value binding happens here in step 2, same as non-connector tasks.
3. **Conditions** — per-scope plugin `impl-json.md`:
   - Stage entry conditions
   - Stage exit conditions
   - Task entry conditions (depends on TaskIds from Phase 2)
   - Case exit conditions
4. **SLA + escalation** — per [`plugins/sla/impl-json.md`](plugins/sla/impl-json.md). Group `tasks.md §4.8` by target (root or stage); write full `slaRules[]` in one mutation per target.
5. **In-expression marker resolution** — per [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md § In-Expression Marker Resolution`](plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md). After all outputs are minted/deduped and bindings/conditions/SLA are written, resolve every `vars.$xref('Stage','Task','output')` marker in `caseplan.json` to bare `vars.<var>` in one sink-blind whole-file pass (input payloads, conditions, SLA, connector bodies). Unresolved triple → ERROR.
6. **End-of-Phase-3 validator pass** — per [`implementation.md § Step 12`](implementation.md). Run Checks 1-6 (=vars.X resolution, Out-arg producer presence, type mismatch, surviving `$xref` markers, resolved-resource I/O completeness, entry-point schema parity). AskUserQuestion for unresolved references (incl. `$xref` markers), pure orphan Out-args, and unbound required inputs / phantom output fields; option (c)/(d) "continue with best-effort emit" preserves forward progress. Check 6 is non-interactive (auto re-run, else log). Never HALT.

Phase 3 produces a `caseplan.json` that should pass authoritative validation. No hard stop on Phase 3 exit — agent proceeds directly to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — Validate

End of detail mutations. Run full-mode validate (omit `--skeleton`; defaults to full):

```bash
uip maestro case validate "<caseplan.json path>" --output json
```

On success: `{ Result: "Success", Code: "CaseValidate", Data: { File, Status: "Valid" } }` — proceed to Phase 4 dump step.

On failure: output lists `[error]` and `[warning]` entries with path and message. Fix reported issues (usually via targeted re-run of earlier step) and re-run `validate`.

### Retry policy

Up to **3 validation retries** per session. After 3rd failure, halt and ask user with **AskUserQuestion**: show remaining errors and options:

- `Retry with fix` — agent attempts fix, re-runs validate (counter does not reset).
- `Pause for manual edit` — exit skill mid-flight; user edits `caseplan.json` directly and re-runs skill.
- `Abort` — exit; dump `build-issues.md`; leave artifacts in place.

### Dump issue log

After successful validate, write issue list to `tasks/build-issues.md` per [`plugins/logging/impl-json.md`](plugins/logging/impl-json.md), grouped by plugin with summary index. Source of truth for completion report. Write even if zero issues logged (confirms clean build).

On Phase 4 success → proceed to Phase 5.

## Phase 5 — Debug

After Phase 4 success, report results then ask user via **AskUserQuestion**:

- `Run debug session` — run `uip solution resources refresh --solution-folder "<SolutionDir>" --output json` then `uip maestro case debug "<directory>/<solutionName>/<projectName>" --log-level debug --output json`. Streams results.
- `Skip to Publish` — proceed to Phase 6 without debugging.

> **Debug executes case for real — sends emails, posts messages, calls APIs, writes to databases. Only run when user explicitly asks. Never auto-run** (Rule 12).

Requires `uip login`. Uploads to Studio Web, runs in Orchestrator, streams results.

After debug completes, return to Phase 5 prompt so user can re-run or move on. Proceed to Phase 6 only on `Skip to Publish`.

### Report fields (printed before prompt)

1. File path of `caseplan.json`.
2. What was built — summary of stages, tasks, conditions, SLA.
3. Validation status — `validate` pass / remaining warnings.
4. Placeholder tasks + unresolved resources — list every placeholder (TaskId, type, display-name, stage) + external resource user must register (task-type-id / connection-id) + wiring-notes from `tasks.md`. Also list **agents / API workflows built inline** (built as in-solution siblings, already bound) and any **built but unreferenced** (reject case) separately — they need no user action. See [placeholder-tasks.md § Completion-Report Shape](placeholder-tasks.md#completion-report-shape).
5. Missing connections — connector tasks needing IS connections that don't exist yet.

### Debug notes

- `uip solution resources refresh` MUST run before debug — syncs resources from `bindings_v2.json` so Studio Web can resolve connector dependencies (Rule 14).
- Debug verifies the build actually runs end-to-end before the user commits to a publish. If debug surfaces a fixable issue, see [Step 13a — Troubleshoot failed case](implementation.md#step-13a--troubleshoot-failed-case) and re-run.
- **Inline-built api-workflow siblings are NOT provisioned by `case debug`** — that task faults with incident `170007` ("job's associated process could not be found") by design; agent siblings do resolve in debug. Verifying that task's runtime needs a full solution deploy (`uip solution pack` → `uip solution publish` → `uip solution deploy run`) — an Orchestrator install, so **offer it via AskUserQuestion, never run it unprompted** (options — `Run full solution deploy` / `Skip (mark debug-unverifiable)`; the Phase 6 no-deploy default applies); if declined, report the task as debug-unverifiable and continue. See [api-workflow/planning.md § Creating an API workflow inline](plugins/tasks/api-workflow/planning.md#creating-an-api-workflow-inline).

## Phase 6 — Publish

After Phase 5 (whether debugged or skipped), prompt via **AskUserQuestion**:

- `Publish to Studio Web` — run `uip solution resources refresh --solution-folder "<SolutionDir>" --output json` then `uip solution upload "<SolutionDir>" --output json`. Print returned `DesignerUrl` on its own line. Exit skill.
- `Done` — exit skill without publishing.

### Publish notes

- `uip solution upload` accepts solution directory (folder containing `.uipx`) directly — no intermediate bundling step.
- `uip solution resources refresh` MUST run before upload — syncs resources from `bindings_v2.json` so Studio Web can resolve connector dependencies (Rule 14).
- Do **NOT** run `uip maestro case pack` + `uip solution publish` unless user explicitly asks for Orchestrator deployment. That path puts case directly into Orchestrator, bypassing Studio Web. Default is always Studio Web.

For further authoring changes (add task, tweak condition, etc.), user updates `sdd.md` and re-runs skill from Phase 1 — skill does not offer in-place incremental edits.

## Placeholder tasks — unchanged semantics

Placeholder tasks (empty `data: {}` for unresolved resources) behave the same in all phases. Phase 2 creates them; Phase 3 does **not** upgrade them to typed tasks — upgrading requires user to register missing resource externally. See [placeholder-tasks.md](placeholder-tasks.md).

> **Agents / API workflows built inline are not placeholders.** When the user picks **Create** at the Rule 17 gate, Phase 1 builds the resource (a side effect — spawns a sub-agent invoking `uipath-agents` / `uipath-api-workflow`, registers the sibling, binds it) so it enters Phase 2 as a fully resolved task. Phase 3 never upgrades it (nothing to upgrade). Only resources the user declined/skipped or whose build failed become placeholders. See [registry-discovery.md § Create-on-Missing](registry-discovery.md#create-on-missing-build-and-rediscovery).

Phase 3 still wires placeholder TaskIds into:
- Task-entry conditions that reference the placeholder.
- Stage-exit `selected-tasks-completed` rules that include the placeholder.

It does **not** write `data.inputs` / `data.outputs` for placeholders. Input binding deferred to user's post-build upgrade pass.

## Abort semantics

Abort can occur at any hard stop:

- Phase 2 first prompt (`Publish for review` / `Skip` / `Abort`).
- Phase 2 second prompt (`Continue to phase 3` / `Abort`) after publishing.
- Phase 4 retry-cap prompt (`Retry with fix` / `Pause for manual edit` / `Abort`).

All follow same cleanup:

1. Dump `build-issues.md`.
2. Print paths.
3. Exit.

No artifact deletion. No rollback. User owns partial state.

## Out of scope

- **Re-ingesting Studio Web edits.** If user edits published placeholder in Studio Web during review, edits are not round-tripped back into local `caseplan.json`. Phase 3 writes on top of local state; Phase 6 re-publish overwrites Studio Web with completed local build.
- **Resuming aborted session.** Re-running skill regenerates `tasks.md` from scratch (Rule 6) and re-executes Phase 2 onwards.
