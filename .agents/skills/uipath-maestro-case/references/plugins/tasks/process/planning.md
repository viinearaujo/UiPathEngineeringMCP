# process task — Planning

An RPA-driven automated process task. Invokes a UiPath process (or agentic process) by name and folder.

## When to Use

Pick this plugin when the sdd.md describes a task as any of:

- `PROCESS` — a regular UiPath process
- `AGENTIC_PROCESS` — an agentic process orchestrated by UiPath
- Generic "run automation X" where X is a published process

For RPA robot tasks specifically, prefer [rpa](../rpa/planning.md). For Coded workflows / API-workflows, use [api-workflow](../api-workflow/planning.md).

## Required Fields from sdd.md

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `display-name` | Process Reference "Name" | Shown in the UI |
| `name` | Process Reference "Name" |  |
| `folder-path` | Resolved registry `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName` (NOT the sdd.md "Folder") | This is the binding's `folderPath` default — Orchestrator starts the job here at runtime. The sdd.md "Folder" only seeds the registry lookup; it may be a parent/truncated path. See [§ Registry Resolution](#registry-resolution). |
| `task-type-id` | Registry resolution (see below) | Enables auto-enrichment via `tasks describe`. |
| `inputs` | sdd.md task data mapping | See [bindings-and-expressions.md](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md) |
| `outputs` | Discovered via `tasks describe` | Listed for downstream cross-task references |
| `runOnlyOnce` | sdd.md (default `true`) |  |
| `isRequired` | sdd.md (default `true`) |  |

## Registry Resolution

1. **Primary cache file:** `process-index.json` for `PROCESS`, `processOrchestration-index.json` for `AGENTIC_PROCESS`.
2. **Identifier field:** `entityKey`.
3. **Cross-type fallback.** If the primary cache file has no match, search both files — the sdd.md label is not authoritative. A process registered as `process` may be mislabeled `AGENTIC_PROCESS` in sdd.md and vice versa.
4. **Match priority:** exact name + exact folder > exact name, multiple folders (pick matching) > exact name only > no match.
5. **`folder-path` = the SELECTED entry's `folders[0].fullyQualifiedName`** (not the sdd.md "Folder" — see the field table above). Fall back to the sdd.md folder only when there is no registry match (Unresolved path).
6. **Discover inputs/outputs:** after resolving the `entityKey`, fetch the input/output schema via `tasks describe` — see [bindings-and-expressions.md § Discovering output names](../../../bindings-and-expressions.md). Record input names, types, and output names. Unrecognized inputs in sdd.md → ask the user (**AskUserQuestion** with matching field names + "Something else").

## Unresolved Fallback

If no match is found across both cache files after `registry pull`:

- Mark the task line: `<UNRESOLVED: process "<name>" in folder "<folder>" not found in registry>`
- Omit `inputs:` and `outputs:`; capture intended wiring in a fenced ```` ```text ```` code block (not `#` prefixed — it renders as markdown H1).
- Continue planning for remaining tasks.
- Execution creates a placeholder task (empty `data: {}`, no bindings). See [placeholder-tasks.md](../../../placeholder-tasks.md).

## tasks.md Entry Format

```markdown
## T<n>: Add process task "<display-name>" to "<stage>"
- taskTypeId: <entityKey>
- folder-path: "<folder>"
- inputs:
  - <input_name> = "<literal-or-expression>"
  - <input_name> <- "<Stage>"."<Task>".<output>
- outputs: <out1>, <out2>, <out3>
- runOnlyOnce: true
- isRequired: true
- order: after T<m>
- lane: <n>  # FE layout; increment per task. Within `runs-sequentially` group, parallel members share a lane (semantic).
- verify: Confirm Result: Success, capture TaskId
```
