# UiPath Case Management Authoring Assistant

Build UiPath Case Management definitions from `sdd.md`. Resolve tenant resources into `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, then write `caseplan.json` directly from the SDD using the applicable per-plugin JSON recipes. The SDD is the plan — there is no intermediate plan file.

> **Authoring invariant:** Never use mutating `uip maestro case` commands (`cases|stages|tasks|*-conditions ... add|update|remove`, including `tasks add-connector`) or explore them with `--help`. Use the CLI only for scaffolding, metadata reads, validation/debug, runtime operations, and solution sync/upload. Consult [case-commands.md](references/case-commands.md) only when exact syntax is needed. CLI availability or a final `validate` requirement never overrides this rule.

When `sdd.md` is absent, case design belongs exclusively to **`uipath-planner`**, which runs its Case Design Lane in this conversation. This skill never designs independently. The lane uses best-assumption design, Listen → Sketch → full design-time tenant resolution, a mandatory other-path sweep, and one decision-first eight-section Case Review. Its Build answer is consent; it writes template-conformant `sdd.md`, then this skill continues immediately with `uip solution init`, Phase 1, and later phases. The same handoff applies to `sdd.draft.md` finalization. Never overwrite an existing `sdd.md`.

**Scope:** greenfield builds from `sdd.md` and brownfield targeted edits to an existing `caseplan.json`; see [references/brownfield.md](references/brownfield.md). For Studio Web cases, pull current server state first with `uip solution download` or `solution projects resync` so publishing cannot clobber server changes.

## When to Use This Skill

Use for:

- Building a Case Management project from `sdd.md`.
- Creating a case when no SDD exists; hand design to `uipath-planner` in this conversation.
- Generating implementation tasks from an SDD.
- Editing an existing `caseplan.json` by targeted intent: stage/task changes, conditions, or triggers.
- Questions about case JSON schema, nodes, transitions, tasks, rules, SLA, or runtime case instances.

Do not use for `.xaml` → `uipath-rpa`, `.flow` → `uipath-maestro-flow`, or standalone agents/APIs/processes outside case context.

## Critical Rules

1. **Design handoff and SDD authority.** If `sdd.md` is absent, immediately invoke `uipath-planner`’s Case Design Lane in this conversation, before reading references or running tenant commands. Do not improvise interviews, design subagents, generic Build Plan approvals, or design-only behavior here. The lane’s single Case Review has exactly these sections: Case Snapshot; Primary Journey; Other Paths Considered; SLA and Escalations; Rules and Outcomes; Resources and Integrations with design-time resolutions; Decisions I Made; Review Flags. It names every stage/task, type, activation/grouping, required status, routing/outcome, and SLA context; `sdd.md` separately contains the complete data contract, variables, and task inputs/outputs. The Build options incorporate Rule 11, and the Build answer is the sole consent. Corrections re-show only changed review sections. Before approval, every `selected-tasks-completed` selector must resolve to a non-adhoc sibling in the same stage. The lane writes `sdd.md` early, then this skill runs `uip solution init <SolutionName>` and Phase 1 without another prompt unless explicitly requested. If the request asks only for the design, stop after `sdd.md`: do not read plugin references, run tenant discovery, or author a substitute plan file. If `sdd.draft.md` is to be finalized, use the lane fast path with target basename `sdd.md`. Never overwrite `sdd.md`.
2. **SDD is the sole post-design input, across sessions.** Trust user-provided or previously written `sdd.md`; do not validate, gap-fill, or silently infer it. In the same conversation as design approval, use the in-memory model that wrote it without rereading. Use AskUserQuestion for build-phase ambiguity. Run a one-Grep receipt spot-check before reading an SDD not watched being written: it must contain `## Section 1: Case Definition` through `## Section 4: Integrations` and at least one `##### Task` block. Freeform/summary SDDs go back through the planner template-conformance gate.
3. **Phase 1 registry gate.** Run `uip login status --output json`, then `uip maestro case registry pull`, before cache inspection, carryover, resolution, or Phase 1 writes. Pull at most once per session. If the planner lane ran in this session, its pull succeeded, and it wrote the SDD, reuse the cache. With the lane’s in-context resolution outcomes, use verify-only planning: persist them verbatim to `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, spot-check cache entries, execute gate decisions, and re-resolve only stale/missing entries. Otherwise run the full gate. Login/pull failure stops Phase 1. Read `~/.uip/case-resources/<type>-index.json` directly; `registry search` has known gaps, especially action-apps. Before a successful pull, missing cache files are failed refresh preconditions, never zero matches; only after success may empty exact-name matches or absent indexes enter empty-lookup handling. Trust the SDD; the pull refreshes discovery only. The planner lane owns design-time resolution, lazily starting login/pull when tenant-bound work first appears, resolving identities with one batched Case Review gate, and recording SDD cells plus its resolution ledger. No schema discovery occurs there.

   **Design-only exception:** when explicitly stopping at `sdd.md` or `sdd.draft.md` without `caseplan.json`, solution, or build, do not run tenant registry, connection, schema, or user-discovery commands. Preserve intended names, leave identities `<UNRESOLVED>`, and report deferred wiring in the reply — never in a substitute plan file. This exception does not apply when the user requests resource/identity resolution, registry refresh, stale-audit replacement, `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, or `tasks/recipients-resolved.json`; then run the normal gate, resolve identities, write the ledger, and stop before Phase 2.
4. **Parsed reads require `--output json`.**
5. **Use plugin references.** `cat` the matching plugin `planning.md` during planning and `impl-json.md` during execution, whole, per Rule 24; never guess JSON shapes.
6. **The build is lossless against the SDD.** Never author an intermediate plan file: `sdd.md` is the plan, and restating it drifts from it. Write one `caseplan.json` element for every SDD stage, task, trigger, condition, SLA rule, variable, and argument, including explicit defaults. Preserve every valid explicit rule/selector exactly; reject and repair invalid `selected-tasks-completed` selectors. Carry stage/task/SLA `Design Rationale` and condition routing/activation rationales into the element's `description` where the schema has one, and into `build-issues.md` where it does not. Preserve every Inputs row, binding mode, and value. Preserve JSON object literals exactly: native object or JSON-encoded string in `input.value`; add `=js:`/`=jsonString:` only when explicitly present in the SDD. Project Outputs through [`plugins/variables/io-binding/planning.md`](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/planning.md#sdd-outputs-table-to-caseplan-projection-mandatory), preserving operator and operands. SDD output rows require `->` or `=`; schema-discovered bare outputs are not authored SDD rows. Never simplify equal-name `->` rows; `greeting -> greeting` differs from schema-discovered bare `greeting`. `—` placeholders are not operands. AskUserQuestion for unrecognized or ambiguous rows; never omit silently. Regenerate greenfield builds from scratch; brownfield edits preserve IDs. Every task node carries its own `entryConditions` derived from its SDD **Entry Condition** table and **Activation Mode** — write it per task, never once for a group of similar tasks; `validate` only warns `Task has no entry rules`, while a miss hangs `case debug` indefinitely. Step 12 enforces this against the finished artifact with `uip maestro case validate <caseplan.json> --strict --sdd sdd.md` (Rule 14): every stage, task, task type, condition row, SLA, trigger and case variable the SDD declares must be present, and a `STRICT_SDD_*` finding names what is missing. See [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md).
7. **Build gate.** Phase 1 auto-proceeds to Phase 2. Stop after resolution only when the request explicitly says design-only, Phase 1 only, review first, or not to build. Re-read `sdd.md` and `tasks/registry-resolved.json` at Phase 2 and Phase 3 entry — context may have compacted.
8. **Unresolved resources.** Never fabricate IDs. Keep `<UNRESOLVED: ...>` in `tasks/registry-resolved.json`. A placeholder task has `type`, `displayName`, structural fields, and `data: {}`; conditions still reference its TaskId. A placeholder event trigger has render fields and only `data.inputs: { serviceType: "Intsvc.EventTrigger" }`; append its `entry-points.json` entry and create no trigger edge. See [references/placeholder-tasks.md](references/placeholder-tasks.md) and [references/plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md](references/plugins/triggers/event/impl-json.md).
9. **Resolution audit.** Persist one object per task in `tasks/registry-resolved.json` with exact keys `stage`, `task`, `taskType`, `cacheFile`, `searchQuery`, `matches`, `selected`, and `rationale`, plus resolved I/O/review metadata. Add `gateDecision` only when the user answered the design-time resource gate; default deferrals have none. `matches` is the complete exact-name set from the refreshed cache; `selected` is a match or `null` after a genuine empty lookup. Same-session planner ledgers are persisted verbatim, then verified/extended under Rule 3. The resolution ledger and `registry-resolved.json` are machine-only — never shown to the user, including in the Case Review.
10. **Cross-task references.** Use `"Stage Name"."Task Name".output_name` and the common output-reference-ID algorithm in [`plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md`](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md#output-reference-id-authoritative). Use the source output’s `.id`; only a custom `=` output without `.id` uses its verified root companion’s `.id`. Never use a reassigned output’s `.var`. Discover names with `uip maestro case spec` for connector tasks or `uip maestro case tasks describe` for non-connectors. In larger `=js:` expressions use `vars.$xref('Stage','Task','output')`, resolved at Step 11.5. See [references/bindings-and-expressions.md](references/bindings-and-expressions.md).
11. **Build-review preference.** Capture once at journey start. Design handoff folds it into the Case Review Build options (`Build it — straight through` or `Build it — pause at the build preview`); provided SDD asks once after the roadmap. Non-interactive and resumed runs without a preference default to straight-through. At Phase 2→3, try `validate --skeleton-v2`; fall back once to legacy `--skeleton` only when the response explicitly says v2 is unknown/unsupported, typically invalid_argument/exit 3. Exit 3 alone is insufficient; real v2 failures are reported. Validation findings do not halt this advisory gate. Straight-through continues without prompting. Pause-at-preview follows [references/phased-execution.md](references/phased-execution.md): AskUserQuestion `Publish for review` / `Skip publish and continue` / `Abort`; on publish, refresh resources, upload with the required filter, print `DesignerUrl` before the follow-up, then ask `Continue to implementation` / `Abort`. Hard stops always remain at Phase 4 retry exhaustion, Phase 5, Phase 6, Phase 7, and any re-publish after a Phase 6 fix.
12. **Never auto-debug or publish to Orchestrator.** `uip maestro case debug` executes real emails, messages, and API calls. Phase 7 (`case pack` → `solution pack` → `solution publish`) ships to the tenant. Each requires its own AskUserQuestion consent.
13. **Artifact I/O.** For `caseplan.json`, `sdd.md`, `sdd.draft.md`, `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, `tasks/trigger-spec-cache.json`, `tasks/spec-cache.<elementId>.json`, `bindings_v2.json`, `id-map.json`, `entry-points.json`, and `build-issues.md`, use only your harness's file tools: `cat <file>` (or the Read tool, if the harness has one) to read, and Write / Edit (or `apply_patch`) to mutate. No Python, Node, jq, sed, awk, scripts, shell redirection, `tee`, `cp`, `mv`, `install`, or `rsync`; no helper scripts, including under `/tmp`, and no agent-authored script of any kind. **Exception — a read-only audit gate is allowed, not banned:** the planner's `audit_sdd.py` run over `sdd.md` writes nothing and only reports, so running it is always allowed. This rule exists to stop an artifact being AUTHORED or EDITED by script — never to stop it being CHECKED; the caseplan's own check is `uip maestro case validate --strict --sdd` (Rule 14). The `node -e ... fs.*` ban covers all file reads, including `~/.uip/case-resources/`; use `cat` (or Read) for cache lookup. If `caseplan.json` exceeds about 30KB, use the preview/detail cadence in [case-editing-operations.md](references/case-editing-operations.md), never a helper. Bash is allowed only for `cat`, UUID v4 generation without filesystem access, CLI metadata, validate, debug, and solution scaffold/upload. Prefixed IDs are chosen inline.
14. **Runnable resources and sidecars.** Before Phase 4, run Step 12 Checks 7, 9, 11, and 12 even when publish, debug, or resource refresh is skipped. A non-null `selected` resource must not become a placeholder: retain `data.name` and `data.folderPath` with complete root bindings, project it into `bindings_v2.json.resources[]`, and make its `resourceKey` self-consistent with its own defaults, never a copied tenant identity/UUID. Checks 9/11 exempt connector nodes; Check 12 covers resolved connector tasks, event triggers, and `wait-for-connector` rules, which require spliced `caseShape.context` plus Connection/Folder root bindings, not degraded typeId/connectionId-only data. CLI validate on the default profile is insufficient: the closing validate at Phase 3 exit and in Phase 4 is `uip maestro case validate <caseplan.json> --strict --sdd sdd.md --output json` (`--sdd` implies `--strict` and audits completeness against the SDD; omit it only when no `sdd.md` exists), and a `Valid` without `"Profile": "strict"` does not close the build. **Version guard:** `--strict`/`--sdd` exist from CLI 1.202. Fall back to plain `validate` only when the response is `invalid_argument` naming `--strict` or `--sdd` as an unknown option (exit 3 alone is insufficient; a strict *failure* is never a reason to drop the flags). On fallback, record `strict profile unavailable on CLI <version>` in `build-issues.md` and in the completion report, and run Step 12 Checks 1–15 by hand. Repair and recheck mismatches; halt before Phase 4 if they remain. Repeat Check 7 before every `resources refresh`. Refresh before every upload or debug. Every `solution upload` uses `--output-filter "{Status: Status, Action: Action, SolutionId: SolutionId, DesignerUrl: DesignerUrl}"`; print the returned DesignerUrl and say whether `Action` was `Imported` or `Overwritten`.
15. **Handoff contract.** Invoke `uipath-planner`’s Case Design Lane in this conversation, never as a subagent. It owns design, resolution, review, and SDD writing; this skill resumes at solution initialization. User-facing language presents one continuous flow and never mentions the handoff. If unavailable, say so in one line, request `sdd.md` or an approved pasted design, and stop. Cross-product planning remains a plain-text suggestion to the planner. Apply the Rule 15 receipt spot-check before unobserved SDD reads.
16. **Closed task types.** `caseplan.json` task `type` must be exactly one of: `process`, `agent`, `rpa`, `action`, `api-workflow`, `case-management`, `execute-connector-activity`, `wait-for-connector`, `wait-for-timer`. Never use plugin folder or CLI names, `external-agent`, `external-workflow`, `document-extraction`, `flow-process`, `wait-for-event`, or other invented values. The unsupported types remain unsupported. See [references/case-schema.md](references/case-schema.md) and the Plugin Index.
17. **Empty lookup gate.** If the same-session ledger has a user `gateDecision`, execute it without asking again: `resolve-at-build` → placeholder; `create-during-build` → inline create; `pick:<name>` → bind it. A missing decision is a default deferral, not consent; run the full gate. For zero matches, use one batched AskUserQuestion grouped by `(name,type)` with: `Force pull and re-resolve`; `Use placeholders for all`; and, only when creatable resources exist and `registry --local` is supported, `Create missing resources inline`. Create only selected `agent` or `api-workflow` resources, invoking `uipath-agents` or `uipath-api-workflow`; never infer Create from SDD content. Other empty types remain placeholder-only. Selected resources with identical I/O may share one build; differing I/O splits later with the anchor retaining the name, and SDD updates require permission. See [registry-discovery.md § 1c](references/registry-discovery.md#1c--dedup-the-selected-builds-one-resource-per-name-and-type), [Create-on-Missing](references/registry-discovery.md#create-on-missing-build-and-rediscovery), and [§ MUST Confirm](references/registry-discovery.md#must-confirm-before-placeholder-fallback).
18. **Layout.** Emit top-level `layout: {}` only. Do not emit node `position`, `style`, `measured`, `width`, `height`, `zIndex`, or edge `data.waypoints`; do not compute positions.
19. **Global output IDs.** Run Step 12 Check 8 once at Phase 3 exit. It is mandatory; do not enter Phase 4 until it passes and do not substitute CLI validate.
20. **No authored edges.** Keep `schema.edges` as `[]`; never author TriggerEdge/Edge objects. Conditions provide stage flow; the first stage uses `case-entered`. Read-only edge shapes are documented in [case-schema.md Appendix](references/case-schema.md#appendix--edge-shapes-read-only--never-author).
21. **Global events and SLA responses.** Model a global external event once as an interrupting secondary-stage `wait-for-connector` entry. Choose SLA response explicitly: `notify-only`, `start-task`, `enter-stage`, `exit-stage`, or `exit-case`. A `start-task` response belongs on the follow-up task’s own `sla-status-change` entry, not a stage entry. Interrupting depends on whether active work stops, pauses, or reroutes; parallel oversight uses `Interrupting: No` and remains secondary. `sla-status-change` names `slaId`; add `escalationId` only for at-risk responses. Without a stated response, at-risk and breach are notifications. Do not replicate rules across primary stages. See [references/sla-response-shapes.md](references/sla-response-shapes.md) and the SLA Response Map.
22. **Formal argument IDs.** `variables.inputs[].id` and `variables.outputs[].id` must be synthetic `v` + 8 characters and distinct from `name`/`var`; never copy companion names. Run Step 12 Check 10 once at Phase 3 exit and non-interactively re-mint violations. CLI validate does not check this. See [global-vars/impl-json.md § Formal-arg slot ID format](references/plugins/variables/global-vars/impl-json.md#formal-arg-slot-id-format).
23. **Never run `uip maestro case init`.** It may create a second solution and separate manifest. Use `uip solution init <SolutionName>` and the T01 direct-JSON scaffold in [implementation.md § Step 6](references/implementation.md#step-6--create-the-case-project-structure). See [case-commands.md § case init](references/case-commands.md#uip-maestro-case-init).
24. **Read references to EOF before mutation.** Every `references/*.md` ends with `<!-- END: <filename> -->`. Ingest a reference with one `cat <path>` — the preferred way on every harness, and the only way on a Bash-only harness; a harness with a Read tool may Read the whole file instead. Before the first Write/Edit using a shape, procedure, constraint, or verification rule, that file's exact END marker must have appeared in tool output during this session. Windowed reads (`sed -n '1,240p'`, `head`), search hits, tables of contents, memory, and sibling references do not satisfy this, and neither does testing that the marker exists (`wc -l`, `tail -n 2`, `grep END`) — read to the marker, do not probe for it. The largest reference is about 68KB and `cat`s cleanly; do not split a read to keep output short. Reopen after compaction or when the prior read is unavailable. Tail contracts are normative.
25. **Unique labels and task names.** Stage `data.label` values are unique case-wide; task `displayName` values are unique across all stages, exact and untrimmed, and contain no `:`. A missing display name binds to the resource name and participates in uniqueness. Condition `displayName` values are unique case-wide across all four condition scopes, so number the `Entry Rule {N}` / `Complete Rule {N}` / `Exit Rule {N}` defaults with a case-wide counter, never a per-stage or per-task one ([case-schema.md § Condition name uniqueness](references/case-schema.md#condition-name-uniqueness)). Assign names in Phase 1; later renaming touches the SDD, plan, ID map, and name-keyed references.

## Routing

| Condition | Journey |
|---|---|
| New case, SDD provided, no caseplan, or rebuild from spec | **Greenfield:** handoff if needed, then Phases 1–7 |
| Existing caseplan and targeted edit intent | **Brownfield:** skip handoff and Phases 1–7; use [brownfield.md](references/brownfield.md) |

Brownfield still requires latest-state pull, debug consent, and Orchestrator-publish consent, and reuses Phase 5–7 contracts.

## User-Facing Roadmap

Print once, after routing and before detailed work, in five lines or fewer. Do not expose phases, modes, filenames, or implementation mechanics.

- **New case without SDD:** `1. I read your request and make the design calls, checking your UiPath tenant along the way. 2. One review packet: case snapshot, primary journey, other paths, SLA responses, business rules, resources, and every decision I made — you confirm or correct. 3. Build and validate without interruptions; the full technical design doc is saved alongside for reference. 4. Pause for your call before any run or publish.`
- **New case with SDD:** `1. Read the design and verify available UiPath resources. 2. One question: build straight through, or pause at a mid-build preview. 3. Plan, build, and validate without further interruptions. 4. Pause for your call before any run or publish.`
- **Targeted edit:** `1. Pull the latest case. 2. Apply the requested change. 3. Validate the updated case. 4. Ask before running or publishing anything.`

## Workflow

Front-load decisions, then run unattended to consent gates:

**Design handoff when required → Phase 1 Planning → Phase 2 Prototyping → Phase 3 Implementation → Phase 4 Validate → Phase 5 Publish → Phase 6 Debug → Phase 7 Publish to Orchestrator.**

At invocation start, present once the matching kickoff block below, at handoff start or Phase 1 start. Status text must follow the Anti-patterns limits.

**Greenfield kickoff:**

> Here's how I'll build this case, and where I'll stop for your call:
> - **Planning** — I draft a task plan from the spec and continue; ask up front if you want to review it first.
> - **Prototyping** — I build the reviewable case flow (stages, tasks, triggers, rules, SLA/escalation; connector rules use stubs). Whether I pause here for a Studio Web preview is **your up-front call** — asked once at the start, never mid-build.
> - **Implementation** — I wire task inputs/outputs, connector schemas, and resolved connector-rule details.
> - **Validate** — I run validation and fix errors.
> - **Publish** (optional) — **you choose** whether to upload to Studio Web.
> - **Debug** (optional) — **you choose** whether to run the case for real (live emails / API calls).
> - **Publish to Orchestrator** (optional) — **you choose** whether to publish the case to Orchestrator.

For handoff, prefix: `First I'll design the case from what you've given me — checking your UiPath tenant along the way — and show one decision-first review packet with the case snapshot, primary journey, other paths, SLA responses, business rules, resources, and every decision made — one confirmation, then I build; the full technical design doc (sdd.md) is saved alongside for reference.`

For brownfield, use the short entry flow in [references/brownfield.md](references/brownfield.md).

### Design handoff

The trigger is binary: if no `.md` whose basename contains `sdd` exists at the resolved path, hand off. If the prompt names another SDD basename, copy it to `./sdd.md` using Read + Write; do not invoke the lane. If no `.md` is named, use `./sdd.md`. Do not read planning/plugin references or run tenant commands before the Case Review. For an explicit no-build design request, write `sdd.md` after approval, without plugin references, schema, registry, connection, or user discovery, then stop — do not author a plan file in place of the build. Planner-owned drafts and `sdd-viewer.html` stay with the planner. If unavailable, request an SDD and stop.

### Phase 1 — Resolution

Read [references/planning.md](references/planning.md) to produce:

- `tasks/registry-resolved.json`: complete resolution audit — tenant identities only, never a copy of the SDD's structure or contract.
- If Create is selected at Rule 17: build selected agents/API workflows as in-solution siblings through the permitted sub-agent paths, ensure a solution exists, register them, refresh resources, rediscover, and bind them. See [registry-discovery.md § Create-on-Missing](references/registry-discovery.md#create-on-missing-build-and-rediscovery).

`tasks/` is adjacent to `sdd.md`, never inside the solution/project. Auto-proceed to Phase 2 unless the request explicitly asks to stop before the build. Re-read `sdd.md` and the ledger first.

### Phase 2 — Prototyping

Read [references/implementation.md](references/implementation.md) and [references/phased-execution.md](references/phased-execution.md). Follow Steps 6–11.9:

1. Step 6: `uip solution init`, project, and root case (T01 direct-JSON recipe in [plugins/case/impl-json.md](references/plugins/case/impl-json.md)); never `case init`.
2. Step 6.1: manual, timer, and event triggers, including Rule 8 placeholders; capture trigger IDs.
3. Step 6.2: global variables and arguments; In-argument `elementId` references the trigger named by `sourceTriggers`, or the primary trigger when blank.
4. Step 6.3: synchronize `entry-points.json` from declared In/Out arguments per [entry-points-sync.md](references/entry-points-sync.md). Emit the `job-attachment` `definitions` block byte-for-byte from that reference — reproduce its `MimeType.description` inner quotes exactly (single-`\"` escaping); never re-escape (`\\"`) or rebalance them, or the JSON breaks.
5. Step 7: stages.
6. Step 9: task shapes; non-connectors get complete `data.inputs[]` with empty values, connectors only `typeId`/`connectionId`, unresolved resources use placeholders.
7. Step 11: SLA/escalation objects with stable IDs.
8. Step 10: all four condition scopes; connector waits use canonical stubs regardless of resolution.
9. Step 11.9: informational skeleton validation with Rule 11 fallback behavior.
10. Apply the Phase 2→3 preference. Preview branch uses resource refresh, filtered solution upload, printed DesignerUrl, and the prescribed continuation gate; Abort writes `build-issues.md` and exits.

### Phase 3 — Implementation

Re-read the SDD's task detail blocks, `tasks/registry-resolved.json`, and `caseplan.json` (Step 9.6), then follow Steps 9.7, 9.8, 10.5, and 11.5:

1. Resolve connector schemas/defaults with `uip maestro case spec`.
2. Bind I/O for all task classes using [io-binding/impl-json.md](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/impl-json.md).
3. Upgrade resolved connector-bound condition stubs in place; unresolved connectors retain stubs and are reported.
4. Resolve in-expression `vars.$xref` markers.
5. Perform resolved-resource emission, preservation, resourceKey, and connector completeness checks.

Proceed directly to Phase 4 after the Phase 3 checks pass.

### Phase 4 — Validate

Run Step 12 once at the Phase 3 boundary. It performs Checks 1–15, including Check 7 sidecar parity, Check 8 global output-ID uniqueness, Check 9 resource emission/preservation, Check 10 formal-arg IDs, Check 11 resourceKey consistency, Check 12 connector completeness, and Check 15 every task carrying a non-empty entry rule (`validate` only warns on a missing one). Then run full `uip maestro case validate`. Retry at most three times, with an edit before every retry; on the third failure, hard-stop with AskUserQuestion: `Retry with fix` / `Pause for manual edit` / `Abort`. Summarize `build-issues.md` using Step 12.1.

### Phase 5 — Publish

Provide the completion report, then hard-stop AskUserQuestion: `Publish to Studio Web` / `Skip to Debug` (Step 13). On publish, refresh resources and upload with the mandatory output filter, print DesignerUrl, and continue to Phase 6 either way.

### Phase 6 — Debug

Hard-stop AskUserQuestion (Step 15): `Run debug session` / `Continue to publish`. On Run, refresh resources, run `uip maestro case debug`, and loop after completion until `Continue to publish`. Never run debug automatically.

### Phase 7 — Publish to Orchestrator

Hard-stop AskUserQuestion (Step 16): `Publish to Orchestrator` / `Done`. On publish, run in order:

1. `uip solution resources refresh`
2. `uip maestro case pack <SolutionDir>/<ProjectName> <SolutionDir>/dist --output json`
3. `uip solution pack <SolutionDir> <SolutionDir>/dist --output json`
4. `uip solution publish <packagePath> --wait --output json`

`case pack` is mandatory because it creates `caseplan.json.bpmn`; `validate` does not. Publish the `solution pack` `.zip`, not the case `.nupkg`; read `<packagePath>` from `Data.Packages`, never guess. `Done` exits.

### Plugin Index

**Structural:** [case/planning.md](references/plugins/case/planning.md), [stages/planning.md](references/plugins/stages/planning.md), [sla/planning.md](references/plugins/sla/planning.md), [global-vars/planning.md](references/plugins/variables/global-vars/planning.md), [io-binding/planning.md](references/plugins/variables/io-binding/planning.md), and [logging/impl-json.md](references/plugins/logging/impl-json.md).

**Tasks:**

| Schema `type` / SDD value | Plugin planning reference | CLI describe type |
|---|---|---|
| `process` | [process](references/plugins/tasks/process/planning.md) | `process` |
| `agent` | [agent](references/plugins/tasks/agent/planning.md) | `agent` |
| `rpa` | [rpa](references/plugins/tasks/rpa/planning.md) | `rpa` |
| `action` | [action](references/plugins/tasks/action/planning.md) | `action` |
| `api-workflow` | [api-workflow](references/plugins/tasks/api-workflow/planning.md) | `api-workflow` |
| `case-management` | [case-management](references/plugins/tasks/case-management/planning.md) | `case-management` |
| `execute-connector-activity` | [connector-activity](references/plugins/tasks/connector-activity/planning.md) | `connector-activity` |
| `wait-for-connector` | [connector-trigger](references/plugins/tasks/connector-trigger/planning.md) | `connector-trigger` |
| `wait-for-timer` | [wait-for-timer](references/plugins/tasks/wait-for-timer/planning.md) | `wait-for-timer` |

Schema-kebab is the only JSON value; plugin and CLI names are not interchangeable. Unsupported types include `external-agent`, `external-workflow`, `document-extraction`, `flow-process`, and `wait-for-event`.

**Triggers:** [manual](references/plugins/triggers/manual/planning.md), [timer](references/plugins/triggers/timer/planning.md), and [event](references/plugins/triggers/event/planning.md).

**Conditions:** [stage-entry-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/stage-entry-conditions/planning.md), [stage-exit-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/stage-exit-conditions/planning.md), [task-entry-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/task-entry-conditions/planning.md), and [case-exit-conditions](references/plugins/conditions/case-exit-conditions/planning.md).

Connector-bound rules in any condition scope require `rule.uipath` built from `case spec --type trigger`; bare connector rules are invalid in Studio Web even when CLI validate passes. See [connector-trigger-impl.md](references/connector-trigger-impl.md).

## Anti-patterns

- Do not leave a regular stage without an entry condition. The first stage uses `case-entered`; every other regular stage needs a reachable predecessor. Edges are retired.
- Do not design here, start Phase 1 before Case Review approval, or build from a summary SDD. The planner owns design, other-path analysis, and template conformance.
- Do not validate after each element or validate twice without an intervening edit. Phase 2 validation is informational; Phase 4 validation is authoritative and runs `--strict` — do not finish on a default-profile `Valid`.
- Do not author `tasks/tasks.md`, a T-numbered task list, or any other restatement of the SDD. The SDD is the plan; Phase 2 writes `caseplan.json` from it directly, and Step 12's `validate --strict --sdd sdd.md` audits the artifact against it.
- Write `caseplan.json` by section, preserving untouched siblings — never one Write for the whole file. Read once at section entry; use per-element Edits for fewer than 10 elements, or one Write covering only that section's container (the stages array, or one stage's task array) for 10 or more; gather CLI-gated sections before writing. Cap any single Write at ~15K output tokens / ~40KB; split a case with ≥40 tasks or ≥8 stages across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 writes rather than emitting the fully populated file at once. Re-read both files after interruption. See [case-editing-operations.md § Per-section batch write contract](references/case-editing-operations.md#per-section-batch-write-contract--canonical).
- Do not emit standalone narration between tool calls. Bundle status with the next tool call; keep ordinary text under 200 tokens and allow-listed kickoff, hard-stop preambles, completion reports, DesignerUrl prints, and validation summaries under 500. Do not announce imminent actions with verbs such as `Building`, `Composing`, `Writing`, `Drafting`, `Generating`, `Now I'll`, `Next`, `Approach`, `Strategy`, `Plan`, `Let me`, or equivalent.
- Preserve ordered task semantics. Sequential mode uses ordered `data.tasks` sets and one `runs-sequentially` rule per task; do not add `current-stage-entered` alongside it. Use parallel `current-stage-entered` only for independent work and `selected-tasks-completed` only for required fan-in. Event-triggered tasks use event/condition rules; manually triggered/adhoc tasks use one `adhoc` rule, `isRequired: false`, and no additional entry event. `adhoc` is an activation mode, not a task type.
- Model secondary stages as interrupting exception lanes: `case-management:Stage`, `data.stageType: "secondary"`, `isRequired: false`, and `Interrupting: Yes` on stage and entries. Use `Interrupting: No` only for parallel SLA oversight. Use `return-to-origin`; do not connect secondary stages as normal flow or count them in required completion.
- Do not replicate global events or SLA rules across primary stages. Case completion requires a root `metadata.caseExitRules[]` rule with `marksCaseComplete: true`; stage completion alone is insufficient. Non-completing outcomes use `marksCaseComplete: false`.
- Do not edit generated `caseplan.json.bpmn`; do not place `caseplan.json` under `content/`; do not fabricate conditional-SLA expression syntax; describe conditions naturally until execution resolves them.
- Do not place `tasks/` in the solution/project; it stays beside `sdd.md`.
- Do not invoke other skills automatically except Rule 15 design handoff and Rule 17’s gate-selected inline creation of agents/API workflows. Do not spawn subagents for design, draft finalization, or plan-only documents.
- Use `uipath-feedback` for trouble.
