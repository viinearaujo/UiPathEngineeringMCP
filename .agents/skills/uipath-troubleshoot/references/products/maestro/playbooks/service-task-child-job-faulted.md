# Service Task Child Job Faulted (170002)

## Context

What this looks like:
- Maestro instance stuck in Running state with an open incident
- Incident error code 170002 — "Failure in the Orchestrator Job"
- Child job launched by a service task has faulted

What can cause it:
- The child RPA job or agent faulted (selector failure, application exception, argument mismatch, etc.)
- The child job was stopped or cancelled externally
- Robot disconnected mid-execution

What to look for:
- The child job's error message and final state — the child's failure reason is the actual root cause, not the parent's error code
- Which service task in the BPMN process triggered the child job
- Whether the service task has a boundary error event attached

## Investigation

Service tasks are a BPMN concept — use the `bpmn` subcommand. For Flow/Case service-equivalent failures, swap `bpmn` for `flow` or `case`.

1. Get full incident details: `uip maestro bpmn instance incidents <instance-id> -f <folder-key> --output json`
2. Get element executions to identify the faulted service task: `uip maestro bpmn instance element-executions <instance-id> -f <folder-key> --output json`
3. Find the child job key from the incident's `errorDetails` and inspect it: `uip or jobs get <child-job-key> --output json` — the child's error message drives the root cause investigation
4. Get child job logs for execution detail: `uip or jobs logs <child-job-key> --level Error --output json`
5. Check whether a boundary error event is attached to the service task (visible in element executions)

## Resolution

- **Resolve the open incident** to unblock the BPMN instance — either retry the service task or mark the incident as resolved, depending on process design
- **Add a boundary error event** to the service task in Studio Web so future child job failures are caught and routed to an error-handling flow (retry, notification, or alternative path) instead of blocking the instance with an unresolved incident
- **Root cause is in the child domain** — investigate the child job failure separately (selector issue, permission error, etc.)
